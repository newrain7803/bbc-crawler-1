    "story_body": "In 1985 the US pulled the plug on a computer-controlled anti-aircraft tank after a series of debacles in which its electronic brain locked guns onto a stand packed with top generals reviewing the device.

    "article_text": "in 1985 the us pulled the plug on a computer-controlled anti-aircraft tank after a series of debacles in which its electronic brain locked guns onto a stand packed with top generals reviewing the device. mercifully it didn't fire, but did subsequently attack a portable toilet instead of a target drone. the m247 sergeant york (pictured above) may have been an embarrassing failure, but digital technology and artificial intelligence (ai) have changed the game since then.today defence contractors around the world are competing to introduce small unmanned tracked vehicles into military service. just like an army on the move, there are contrasting views about how far and how fast this technology will advance. above all, designers are testing the limits of human control and machine independence, the ultimate goal of autonomy.  will this new generation of mini-tanks change the face of warfare? how much autonomy can they be trusted with?estonian soldiers currently serving in mali are going out on patrol with an unmanned ground vehicle or ugv. the size of a sit-on lawn-mower with tracks, it carries heavy supplies such as water and ammunition. trundling behind a conventional armoured personnel carrier it resembles an obedient younger sibling. uk defence technology group qinetiq presented the british army with a selection of these vehicles during a month-long trial on salisbury plain in late 2018. the basic ugv came from the estonian company milrem, but qinetiq integrated a series of technology options onto it to create a trio of military roles. depending on the option chosen the ugv, known as titan, can carry supplies or a heavy machine gun, or it can stand guard over its human comrades, using infra-red sensors and thermal imaging to supplement a battery of cameras. running on an electric-diesel hybrid engine titan can be controlled by a human operator or sent off to perform tasks directed by its own software which can decide when to switch between power sources. keith mallon is in charge of ugvs at qinetiq. while a small tank weaving across a muddy plain is a curious sight, he focuses on the digital contents of the ugv. \"we've had robotics for years, but the information revolution means it can navigate on its own.\"machine learning, a subset of the artificial intelligence (ai) revolution, means software embedded in titan recognises patterns. data from its cameras and other sensors is matched to prior examples so it can navigate to a chosen destination. the idea is to have minimal human intervention while titan goes about supporting the troops or exploring a dangerous area. but the freedom qinetiq will grant to the ugv is strictly limited. when it comes to firing a gun or anti-tank missile mounted on the chassis a human must always be in the loop to decide on the use of lethal force. \"we will never give software the capability to fire a weapon,\" says keith mallon.does all this mean robot mini-tanks have really won acceptance?nick entwistle spent 19 years serving in the british army in tanks and armoured vehicles. today he advises the army and has studied the results of the salisbury plain trials. he points out that warfare throws up choices that go way beyond the capabilities of current ai technology. \"even humans have trouble discriminating between a civilian and a combatant. and human beings are adept at reading situations. but look at afghanistan where the enemy hid among civilians. so autonomy is not going to happen for some time. the technology is further away than some like to think.\" across the atlantic us defence contractor flir has been buying up robotics firms in order to put together a ugv package with a group of technology and engineering firms, team ripsaw. this group has adapted the ripsaw, a small tracked vehicle with sports car speeds popularised on tv and by hollywood. originally marketed as a millionaire's plaything and subsequently starring in fast and furious 8, the ripsaw may be about to earn further recognition as an unmanned war machine. it has been chosen for detailed testing by the us army's robotic combat vehicle (rcv) programme. after evaluating a whole crop of ugvs the army intends to field some for real by the mid-2020s. team ripsaw uses a handful of sophisticated visual and thermal sensors to see all around the ugv in day and night. these sensors live inside a gimbal on a mast that can be extended to peer far and wide. the big challenge is to pre-plan a mission and then let the ugv go and do it independently of an operator with radio control. this is where ai comes in. david ray is a senior flir executive and ex-us air force communications expert who served on air force one. as he sees it ai is \"about object detection, how you tell the difference between a broomstick and a gun\".again, machine learning is the key, showing the ripsaw's digital mind a succession of images that build up a comparative picture of the world. self-driving cars can be programmed to recognise everyday events from videos. but you simply cannot show a machine real images of every possible situation that might arise in war. so synthetic training aids, familiar from flight simulators and using hyper-realistic computer-generated images have been brought to bear. these reflect combat conditions. the machine-learning software builds up a library of capabilities as it absorbs images of conflict. this merging of different technologies represents a big breakthrough for ugvs. david ray talks of the ripsaw as \"very fast and flexible and able to traverse difficult terrain such as sand dunes\". it uses an electric-diesel hybrid motor that can transition to a silent approach in stark contrast to the barrage of noise laid down by conventional tanks. the us army wants a discreet machine that can creep up on its target. the real revelation about the team ripsaw vehicle lies in what flir calls its marsupial character. the little tank can open a hatch under its angled front to disgorge a junior robot partner, a smaller tracked machine based on a bomb disposal robot. this scuttles away into confined spaces to look for enemies lurking inside buildings or to detect toxic substances such as nerve agents. the robot family doesn't stop there. a quadcopter drone can rise from the rear of the ugv to carry out aerial reconnaissance on behalf of its terrestrial team-mates. this is layered surveillance, keeping manned vehicles well back from danger while a trio of tech-heavy toys spy on threats. like titan, team ripsaw has an armed option which resembles a smaller version of a normal tank.as with his uk counterparts, david ray is emphatic that a human will always be in the loop before firing."

    "article_text": "president trump made a series of claims about his record in office - on the us economy and on the environment - during his speech to the world economic forum at the swiss resort of davos. we've looked at some of them:  mr trump has  for improving air and water quality in the us before.however, his critics point to steps that reverse environmental protection and to .air quality in the us ranks as 10th best in the world, according to the environmental performance index, created by researchers at yale and columbia universities. drinking water in the us is named as joint top along with countries including the uk, canada and finland. the annual rate of growth in gross domestic product (gdp) - the value of goods and services in the economy - has been between 2% and 3% under mr trump.  but under president clinton, the annual growth rate was higher - reaching over 4%. and if you look at the quarterly gdp growth rate, there was a period under president obama, in 2014, when it reached 5.5%. that's not been matched during mr trump's term in office.according to government statistics, just over seven million jobs have been added since november 2016, when mr trump won the us election, although he didn't assume office until january 2017. barack obama added 7.8 million jobs in his last three years in office. and there has been job growth in the us for 110 consecutive months, with the trump administration continuing an upward trend.mr trump didn't give details about which experts he was referring to or precisely when the prediction was made. but the congressional budget office in january 2016 predicted real gdp would grow by. and it predicted that from 2018 to 2020, the economy would grow at an average annual rate of 2%.as for jobs, the bureau of labor statistics said in december 2015  jobs would grow at an average of 0.5% a year between 2014 and 2024 - about 7.9 million in total. mr trump frequently highlights his success in growing the manufacturing sector and compared his record against that of his his predecessors, george w bush and barack obama, in this speech.at the start of 2001, compared with the end of 2016, there were about 54,000 more private manufacturing establishments (factories) in the us, according to the us bureau of labor statistics.in terms of new factories, the most recent statistics are for the second quarter of 2019. and compared with when president trump took office, in 2017, there were roughly 12,000 more manufacturing establishments. most of these are small businesses, with fewer than five employees. the number of factories overall started to increase in 2013, during the obama administration.we don't know exactly which welfare programmes mr trump is referring to. the us has federal welfare programmes administered by individual states, which may supplement these with their own schemes. we've looked at the biggest federal ones:but we don't know how many claimed more than one benefit, so it's difficult to reach an overall number of people \"lifted off welfare\" under president trump. and introduce changes in how poverty is measured that would result in reducing welfare assistance to some low-income households.: the african-american unemployment rate hit 5.5% in september 2019, the lowest rate recorded since the us labor department started collecting these statistics, in 1972. the unemployment rate has since risen slightly to 5.9%.however, there is a disparity in weekly wages between racial groups.black men on average earn 26% less than white men and the disparity between hispanic men and white men is wider still, according to the latest official statistics.

    "article_text": "a newly-discovered part of our immune system could be harnessed to treat all cancers, say scientists. the cardiff university team discovered a method of killing prostate, breast, lung and other cancers in lab tests. , have not been tested in patients, but the researchers say they have \"enormous potential\".experts said that although the work was still at an early stage, it was very exciting. our immune system is our body's natural defence against infection, but it also attacks cancerous cells.the scientists were looking for \"unconventional\" and previously undiscovered ways the immune system naturally attacks tumours. what they found was a t-cell inside people's blood. this is an immune cell that can scan the body to assess whether there is a threat that needs to be eliminated. the difference is this one could attack a wide range of cancers.\"there's a chance here to treat every patient,\" researcher prof andrew sewell told the bbc.he added: \"previously nobody believed this could be possible.\"it raises the prospect of a 'one-size-fits-all' cancer treatment, a single type of t-cell that could be capable of destroying many different types of cancers across the population.\"t-cells have \"receptors\" on their surface that allow them to \"see\" at a chemical level.the cardiff team discovered a t-cell and its receptor that could find and kill a wide range of cancerous cells in the lab including lung, skin, blood, colon, breast, bone, prostate, ovarian, kidney and cervical cancer cells.crucially, it left normal tissues untouched. exactly how it does this is still being explored. this particular t-cell receptor interacts with a molecule called mr1, which is on the surface of every cell in the human body.it is thought mr1 is flagging the distorted metabolism going on inside a cancerous cell to the immune system. \"we are the first to describe a t-cell that finds mr1 in cancer cells - that hasn't been done before, this is the first of its kind,\" research fellow garry dolton told the bbc.t-cell cancer therapies already exist and the development of cancer immunotherapy has been one of the most exciting advances in the field.the most famous example is car-t - a living drug made by genetically engineering a patient's t-cells to seek out and destroy cancer. car-t can have dramatic results that transform some patients from being terminally ill to being in complete remission.however, the approach is highly specific and works in only a limited number of cancers where there is a clear target to train the t-cells to spot. and it has struggled to have any success in \"solid cancers\" - those that form tumours rather than blood cancers such as leukaemia.the researchers say their t-cell receptor could lead to a \"universal\" cancer treatment. the idea is that a blood sample would be taken from a cancer patient.their t-cells would be extracted and then genetically modified so they were reprogrammed to make the cancer-finding receptor. the upgraded cells would be grown in vast quantities in the laboratory and then put back into the patient. it is the same process used to make car-t therapies.however, the research has been tested only in animals and on cells in the laboratory, and more safety checks would be needed before human trials could start.lucia mori and gennaro de libero, from university of basel in switzerland, said the research had \"great potential\" but was at too early a stage to say it would work in all cancers.\"we are very excited about the immunological functions of this new t-cell population and the potential use of their tcrs in tumour cell therapy,\" they said.daniel davis, a professor of immunology at the university of manchester, said: \"at the moment, this is very basic research and not close to actual medicines for patients.  \"there is no question that it's a very exciting discovery, both for advancing our basic knowledge about the immune system and for the possibility of future new medicines.\""

    "date": "20 January 2020",
    "story_body": "Later this week, thousands will head to Manhattan's historic Chinatown to celebrate Lunar New Year. But amidst all the pomp and the parades, revellers might also find themselves caught up in a healthy dose of politics, writes Zhaoyin Feng of the BBC's Chinese Service. ",
    "article_text": "later this week, thousands will head to manhattan's historic chinatown to celebrate lunar new year. but amidst all the pomp and the parades, revellers might also find themselves caught up in a healthy dose of politics, writes zhaoyin feng of the bbc's chinese service. almost every day, 76-year-old fang yanhua, the president of the chinese-american group suyuan association, follows the same routine, which includes playing mah-jong for hours at the association's office at new york city's chinatown in lower manhattan. drastic change is unusual in the historic district. but a seemingly small change, made by suyuan association, has sparked a heated and profound debate within the community.   in august 2018, for the first time in nearly a century, the association raised the people's republic of china's five-starred red flag.it replaces another chinese flag commonly known as the blue sky, white sun and a wholly red earth, the national flag of the republic of china (roc) , which ceased to be used, except in taiwan, when the prc was founded in 1949.\"i am chinese, so i support china,\" mr fang told the bbc. when he was born in southern china in 1943, the country still flew the roc flag, which is now history in fang's view. \"the historical current has changed direction.\"the roc was founded in 1912 and ruled by the kuomintang party. in 1949, after the chinese communist party defeated the kuomintang in the civil war, the ccp founded the people's republic of china (prc) in beijing, and the kuomintang retreated to taiwan, claiming taipei as the temporary capital. the five-starred red flag is prc's national flag, while the roc flag is now mainly displayed in taiwan, which has been effectively independent but regarded by beijing as a rebel region for more than 70 years. in mainland china, the roc flag is usually only seen in museums and history television series, or as a sign of nostalgia to the \"old china\". in taiwan, the prc flag is largely considered as an unwelcome symbol of beijing's aggression. in international events, taiwan is banned from using the roc's name, emblems and flags. in 2015, during a washington dc event to commemorate the end of world war ii in asia, the chinese ambassador to the us cui tiankai cancelled his attendance at the last minute, due to a wreath displaying the roc's national emblem.  the two china flags are rarely displayed together, with overseas chinatowns as one of the few exceptions.   across a narrow alley from the suyuan association, the chinese consolidated benevolent association (ccba), the oldest and largest chinese american association founded in 1883, flies its roc flag proudly. \"i don't agree that changing to the prc flag is the general trend. they (suyuan association) simply pursue a different political vision from ours,\" eric ng, president of ccba, told the bbc.  the president of the ccba used to be called \"chinatown mayor\", but mr ng may be losing his grip. most newly established chinese-american groups fly the prc flag, and across the country the prc flag has become more and more ubiquitous in america's chinatowns, as several older associations in new york city, los angeles and san francisco changed over.mr ng attributed the phenomenon to a large influx of immigrants from mainland china in the recent years, who are politically pro-beijing and now hold leadership positions in various immigrant associations. the rise of china plays a role too. \"china is now stronger,\" mr fang says.his association had considered switching flag years ago, inspired by china's soaring political and economic status in the world.when the suyuan association adopted the new flag, anti-beijing protestors gathered in the street outside. mr fang, now a us citizen, says he respects the rights to protest and dissent in the us, and acknowledges it's not the case in china. \"in america, one can criticize president donald trump, but in china, one can't do the same to president xi jinping.\" but the flag switch was not at all political, insists 72-year-old kuang junlin, co-president of suyuan association.\"we just wanted to express our love for the motherland,\" he told the bbc.he says the prc flag represents \"mother\", while the roc flag is \"grandmother.\" rising tension between taipei and beijing may be another contributing factor. taiwan's presidenjt tsai ing-wen has been vocal in her opposition to beijing's attempts to exert authority over her country., she said china needs to \"face reality\" and show the island \"respect\".beijing is unhappy with her stand, as are some chinese-americans.\"we support a unified china and would not accept taiwan independence,\" says  junlin kuang, a former chairman of suyuan association.meanwhile, remus li-kuo chen, a senior diplomat of taipei, told media that the flag switch highlights mainland china's increased efforts of minimizing taiwan's international space.almost all chinese-american associations that switched flags made the decision by casting a direct vote among members. \"we follow the american rule, as we live in america now,\" mr fang says.he prefers decision-making in the democratic way because \"the association belongs to all of us\". only 100 out of the suyuan association's 700 members voted on the flag change, but among those who casted a vote, more than 95 percent supported the change.\"the two china flags are flying side by side, mirroring the freedom to identify in the us,\" nancy yao maasbach, president of the museum of chinese in america, told the bbc.the changing of flags is associated with a thoughtful, reflective and potentially painful conversation among chinese immigrants about their mixed identity, she says. though discontent with suyuan association's decision, mr ng agreed to disagree. whenever ng and fang occasionally run into each other on the bustling streets in chinatown, they will still nod at and greet each other in taishanese, their shared mother tongue. \"i believe in free will,\" mr ng says."

    "article_text": "debutants nigeria are set to face england at the under-19 cricket world cup, but as janine anthony reports from lagos, cricket is still very much a minority sport in the west african country.the players knelt down, praised god and some even cried after the winning runs were struck that saw nigeria through to their first-ever cricket world cup.bowler peter aho, who had only just turned 16, scored the crucial runs in a closely fought victory over sierra leone at last year's qualifying tournament in namibia.but there was no collective holding of breath at home among nigeria's 200 million people as the final overs were played.most nigerians do not care for cricket.in fact, only a handful of people in africa's most populous nation - the players' families and close friends - even knew that the team, nicknamed the junior yellow greens, were on the verge of making history.but that took nothing from the emotions of those involved as the qualifying game reached its climax.aho's teammates stood behind the boundary looking on, hoping that the gathering rain clouds would not disrupt the game and stop nigeria sealing victory.one team official could not watch, he turned his back to the action.this was not how it was supposed to be but sierra leone, considered a weak side, forced a middle-order batting collapse.aho came in to bat with his side still needing 52 runs for qualification.as he struck what would be the final ball and made his run, there was an explosion of emotion. his teammates charged forward, the official who could not watch swung around and sped off with the rest towards the batsmen.they all embraced aho - he had done it, they had done it, nigeria was going to the world cup.looking back, team captain sylvester okpe found the fact that his team qualified hard to believe.\"sometimes, i pinch myself. in fact, we still google the moment to be sure it's not a dream,\" he said.for a team that had been relegated to the second division of african cricket in 2015 and only got back into the top division in 2018, getting to the world cup was beyond what many had imagined.\"i can say we are like the leicester city of cricket\u2026 we shocked the world,\" okpe said.he was referring to the exploits of english premier league side who against the odds became champions in 2016 a year after almost being relegated. a football comparison is handy as few of his compatriots understand the game the junior yellow greens play.this is despite the fact that cricket has a long history in nigeria, spanning more than a century.the british colonialists imported the sport and nigeria played its first international match against another british colony - the gold coast (now ghana) in 1904. the team was entirely made up of british colonial administrators.but unlike in india, another british colony, the game never really took off among most of the population.in nigeria, football is king.there are cricket grounds dotted around the country but few people have ever seen a game and the cost of the equipment needed to play is a barrier if people want to get involved. \"people in nigeria don't take cricket as a sport,\" said fast bowler taiwo mohammed.\"they love football over cricket so we just want to show the world that we have something in cricket and we want to get the world interested,\" he said.if nigeria's young cricketers are going to prove themselves then a difficult test awaits them in south africa. they are in a hard group facing australia, england and west indies - all previous winners of the under-19 world cup.in their opening match on monday, nigeria were thrashed by 10 wickets by australia, proving how tough things might be.but, speaking before the first match, captain okpe was not fazed. he insisted that the team have shown a good fighting spirit that has helped them to exceed their limits.\"if we could get more individuals and families and friends all over to support us during the course of the world cup, we could do much better as a team,\" he said.but coach clive ogbimi recognises that more needs to be done to secure any wins at the tournament.\"in bowling and fielding we are more defensive. batting hasn't been really up to the level we want,\" he said.\"even at the qualifiers we were probably rated the lowest and so obviously it was a situation whereby we were snatching victories from the jaws of defeat.\"the team would have to repeat their feat from the qualifiers if they hope to make it past the group stage at the world cup.however, aho, the hero of the team in namibia, is imagining a path to the final next month. \"i strongly believe we are going to beat if not three but two and qualify for the semi-finals and maybe play india at the finals.\"we are really hoping and we are training hard and i believe we will get there,\" he said.nigerian cricket expert seun ajidagba is more realistic.\"they should not be too concerned about winning or losing but the experience that can be gained from participating,\" he said."

    "article_text": "the us house of representatives has impeached president donald trump, and the republican leader now faces a trial in the senate.members of the upper house will decide whether to remove mr trump from office. as the republican party hold a senate majority, he will likely be acquitted.but house impeachment managers - in essence, the prosecutors - will try to convince senators that the president should be ousted from the white house, for abuse of power and obstruction of congress.it is the third time an impeachment trial has happened in the senate.here is our guide to the cast of characters, including the lawyers who will defend mr trump and those who will seek to have him removed from office. this is not the first impeachment for some of the key players in this political drama. mr mcconnell took part in impeachment and senate trial of president bill clinton in 1999.back then, he was the chair of the senate rules committee, and a member of the \"conservative coalition\" - a bi-partisan group of senators representing southern states. mr mcconnell is currently setting out the rules of the trial with the minority leader, democratic member  - although as majority leader, mr mcconnell will have the final say. the republican senator drew fire after he said there would be \"total co-ordination\" with the white house in the process. senators are expected to act as impartial jurors in the process.currently, he is battling with democratic leaders over  in the trial. mr roberts is the youngest chief justice of the us in more than 200 years, taking the position in 2005 at the age of 50. he made his older colleagues laugh recently when .mr roberts will preside over the impeachment trial, making sure all sides stick to the rules. he swore in senators as jurors early in january.he is ideologically conservative, although he has worked with liberal judges on the supreme court before and has repeatedly stated his belief that the body should be non-political.  when the president criticised a jurist who did not back his immigration policies as an \"obama judge\".\"we do not have obama judges or trump judges, bush judges or clinton judges,\" mr robert said. \"what we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"mr schiff is the leader of the seven house impeachment managers: he and jerry nadler, as well as house of representatives members , , ,  and .these democrats will lay out the case against the president in a bid to have him removed from office.mr schiff represents california's 28th congressional district and is chairman of the house intelligence committee. as such, he has become the face of the impeachment proceedings, and a hate figure for mr trump and his supporters. the president has launched furious attacks against the massachusetts-born 59-year-old. sleazy adam schiff, the totally biased congressman looking into \"russia,\" spends all of his time on television pushing the dem loss excuse!end of twitter post  by @realdonaldtrumpmr schiff said he was \"humbled\" by his appointment as lead prosecutor. admirers see him as the man with extensive knowledge of the impeachment case, best suited to present it to the senate.another key figure in the democratic impeachment process is mr nadler, the head of the house judiciary committee.a new yorker, the 72-year-old has served as a congressman since 1992, and has a reputation as a passionate defender of civil liberties with a very liberal voting record. like mr mcconnell, he was also in politics during the last impeachment. the congressional record shows  in 1998.mr cipollone will lead mr trump's defence, alongside the president's personal lawyer . before now, his biggest role in the impeachment proceedings were letters he sent to mr nadler, declaring that the white house would not take part in the inquiry and describing the process as a \"charade\".mr trump named mr cipollone as white house counsel in december 2018. he also advised the president during special counsel robert mueller's investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election.the new york lawyer is the chief counsel at the american center for law & justice, a conservative organisation. he is known to have deep ties to the evangelical community. he has argued in front of the us supreme court a number of times -

    "article_text": "it is hard to exaggerate the importance - and the self-importance - of the hundred men and women who make up the us senate. they are kings of the universe, and expect to be treated as such. flunkies accompany them wherever they go, a veritable army of interns take care of the tedious mundanities of life; they have legislative affairs directors, communications chiefs, fundraising teams, speechwriters. but this week, and for only the third time in american history, the senators become humble - or not so humble - jurors. and the sergeant at arms of the senate has already told them in no uncertain terms they need to be on their best behaviour.and something amazing happened. they fell silent. the usual conversations about holidays, good restaurants, gossip about who might be about to stick a knife into whom came to a halt. there was hush. it was a slightly spine tingling moment. it was as though the gravity, the solemnity of the undertaking was dawning. they were about to try the president, with the power to remove him from office if two-thirds of the senators voted for it.  the battle still to be had between democrats and republicans is whether witnesses will be called. one person i spoke to said you should think of this like the old cold war strategy of mad - mutually assured destruction. for every john bolton called by the democrats - donald trump's former national security adviser who was reportedly deeply unhappy about what was going on; there's a hunter biden - the former vice president's son - whom the republicans might subpoena. one impeachment expert told me he thought this would be a trial that would proceed with no witnesses at all.the senators have also been given a memorandum about decorum; the sort of instructions that are given to a group of 11-year-olds when they move from their freewheeling primary school to secondary school. \"during the impeachment proceedings, standing will not be permitted on the floor and this requirement will be strictly enforced,\" the memo informs them. \"accordingly, all senators are requested to remain in their seats at all times they are on the senate floor during the impeachment proceedings.\" and it goes on: \"no use of phones or electronic devices will be allowed in the chamber. all electronics should be left in the cloakroom in the storage provided.\" don't speak to your neighbour; don't bring any reading material that isn't relevant to the subject under discussion. and no flicking of ink pellets. ok, i made that last bit up, but you get the drift.the supreme court chief justice john roberts, who will preside over the trial also made them swear an oath to \"do impartial justice\".you might get silence, you might get the senator to give up their smart phones, you might even get everyone sitting down - but impartial justice? that's a taller order. because - for all the talk of juries and witnesses, and evidence and judges - this only looks like a judicial process. ultimately, it is political. and as things stand on the key issue at hand - whether donald trump committed high crimes and misdemeanours in his behaviour with the ukrainian president, and his efforts to thwart the congressional investigation that flowed from it - it is pretty clear how the jury is going to fall. the 53 republicans will vote to acquit; the 47 democrats will vote to convict. and donald trump will walk free - potentially to become the first impeached president in the history of the united states to win re-election."

    "article_text": "china's top leaders have warned lower-level officials not to cover up the spread of a new coronavirus that has now infected nearly 300 people.anyone who concealed new cases would \"be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity\", the political body responsible for law and order said.the warning came as state media said six people had now died from the virus, which causes a type of pneumonia.it's been confirmed the virus can pass from person to person.the world health organization (who) will on wednesday consider declaring an international public health emergency over the virus - as it did with swine flu and ebola. such a declaration, if made, will be seen as an urgent call for a co-ordinated international response.china's national health commission on monday confirmed for the first time that the infection could be transmitted from human-to-human. it said two people in guangdong province had been infected in this way.in a separate statement, the wuhan municipal health commission said at least 15 medical workers in wuhan have also been infected with the virus, with one in a critical condition. the workers presumably became infected with the virus due to contact with patients. all of them are being kept in isolation while being treated.a total of 291 cases have now been reported across major cities in china, including beijing and shanghai. however most patients are in wuhan, the central city of 11 million at the heart of the outbreak. the disease was first identified there late last year and the outbreak is believed to be linked to a seafood market that also sells live animals.a handful of cases have also been identified abroad: two in thailand, one in japan, one in south korea and one in taiwan. those infected had recently returned from wuhan.authorities in many places, including australia, singapore, hong kong, taiwan and japan have stepped up screening of air passengers from wuhan. us authorities last week announced similar measures at airports in san francisco, los angeles and new york.in australia, a man who had travelled to wuhan has been placed in isolation and is undergoing tests. china is the largest source of tourists to australia, with more than one million people visiting last year.there are fears that the virus could spread swiftly - and further across the country - as millions of people across china prepare to travel home for the chinese new year holidays later this week. this mass movement of people could also mean that authorities will not be able to monitor further spread of the disease.and experts say there already could be many cases going undetected. a report by the mrc centre for global infectious disease analysis at imperial college london suggested there could be more than 1,700 infections. however, gabriel leung, the dean of medicine at the university of hong kong, put the figure closer to 1,300.the outbreak has revived memories of the sars virus - also a coronavirus originating in china - that killed 774 people in the early 2000s across several countries, mostly in asia.china initially withheld information about the epidemic from the public. it later vastly under-reported the number of people that had been infected, downplayed the risks and failed to provide timely information that experts say could have saved lives.analysis of the genetic code of the new virus shows it is more closely related to sars than any other human coronavirus.chinese president xi jinping has called for \"all-out efforts\" to control the outbreak, according to state media, including quickly making information available and taking measures to \"guide public opinion\". in its commentary published online on tuesday, the communist party's central political and legal commission talked of china having learned a \"painful lesson\" from the sars epidemic and called for the public to be kept informed. deception, it warned, could \"turn a controllable natural disaster into a man-made disaster\".the virus, known also as 2019-ncov, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans.it is believed to have originated from infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in wuhan. coronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, but only six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people. the world health organization has advised people to avoid \"unprotected\" contact with live animals, thoroughly cook meat and eggs, and avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms.signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties."

    "article_text": "us president donald trump has decried climate \"prophets of doom\" in a speech at the world economic forum in davos, where sustainability is the main theme.he called for a rejection of \"predictions of the apocalypse\" and said america would defend its economy.mr trump did not directly name the teenage climate activist greta thunberg, who was in the audience.later, she excoriated political leaders, saying the world \"in case you hadn't noticed, is currently on fire\".environmental destruction is at the top of the agenda at the annual summit of the world's decision-makers, which takes place at a swiss ski resort. in his keynote speech, mr trump said that it was a time for optimism, not pessimism, in a speech that touted his administration's economic achievements and america's energy boom.speaking of climate activists, he said: \"these alarmists always demand the same thing - absolute power to dominate, transform and control every aspect of our lives.\"they were, he said, \"the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers\".mr trump also announced that .\"we're committed to conserving the majesty of god's creation and the natural beauty of our world,\" he said.the president was speaking hours before his impeachment trial began in the us senate. soon after mr trump spoke, ms thunberg, the 17-year-old swedish climate activist who has led a global movement of school strikes calling for urgent environmental action, opened a session on \"averting a climate apocalypse\".she refrained from naming mr trump but issued this warning to the world's leaders. \"i wonder, what will you tell your children was the reason to fail and leave them facing... climate chaos that you knowingly brought upon them? that it seemed so bad for the economy that we decided to resign the idea of securing future living conditions without even trying? \"our house is still on fire. your inaction is fuelling the flames by the hour, and we are telling you to act as if you loved your children above all else.\"she strongly criticised politicians and business leaders for what she said were continuous \"empty words and promises\".\"you say: 'we won't let you down. don't be so pessimistic.' and then, silence.\"the timing of president trump's \"don't panic\" message is intriguing.he's reassuring the davos rich club about the climate just as the pillars of capitalism are themselves starting to treat global warming as a crisis.the leading bank goldman sachs will no longer fund new investments in arctic oil or in coal for power stations.and the boss of investment giant blackrock has defined climate change as the biggest threat to markets as rising temperatures put profits at risk.his company manages more than $6.5 trillion (\u00a35tn) of savers' cash.meanwhile the outgoing governor of the bank of england warns that firms which don't change will go to the wall.president trump - astride an american economy fuelled by cheap gas - thinks they are wrong.and he's not alone. leaders in australia, brazil, russia and saudi arabia also cling to economies driven by fossil fuels.it's politics vs science: the battle of our age.economist joseph stiglitz, a nobel laureate, criticised mr trump's speech. according to reuters news agency he said it was \"astounding\" and made \"as if what we are seeing with our eyes are not there\".the joint leader of germany's green party, robert habeck, was scathing.\"only self-praise, ignorance, disregard for everyone, no perception of global problems. it was the worst speech i've ever heard in my life.\"the world's nations committed in the 2015 paris agreement to keep temperatures well inside 2.0c (3.6f) above pre-industrial times.  they agreed to try to keep the rise to 1.5c but scientists say they are well off that target.last year, the intergovernmental panel on climate change said the earth was heading instead for 3c and that \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\" would be needed to keep to the preferred target of 1.5c. the renowned naturalist and broadcaster david attenborough recently told the bbc that \"the moment of crisis has come\" in efforts to tackle climate change, referencing the bushfires that have ravaged parts of south-eastern australia., which mr trump has called a \"bad deal.\" the pull-out will take effect the day after the 2020 us presidential election - assuming that mr trump is re-elected."

    "article_text": "coca-cola will not ditch single-use plastic bottles because consumers still want them, the firm's head of sustainability has told the bbc.customers like them because they reseal and are lightweight, said bea perez.the firm, which is one of the world's biggest plastic waste polluters, has pledged to recycle as many plastic bottles as it uses by 2030. but environmental campaigners argue many coke bottles would still go uncollected and end up in landfill.the drinks giant produces about three million tonnes of plastic packaging a year - equivalent to 200,000 bottles a minute.  in 2019, it was found to be the most polluting brand in a global audit of plastic waste by the charity break free from plastic.but speaking at the world economic forum in davos, ms perez said the firm recognised it now had to be \"part of the solution\".coke has pledged to use at least 50% recycled material in its packaging by 2030. it is also partnering with ngos around the world to help improve collection. however, ms perez said the firm could not ditch plastic outright, as some campaigners wanted, saying this could alienate customers and hit sales. she also said using only aluminium and glass packaging could push up the firm's carbon footprint.\"business won't be in business if we don't accommodate consumers,\" she said.\"so as we change our bottling infrastructure, move into recycling and innovate, we also have to show the consumer what the opportunities are. they will change with us.\"ms perez said she respected the idealism of youth activists, such as 19-year-old campaigner melati wijsen, who with her sister isabel, convinced the island of bali to ban single-use plastic bags, straws and styrofoam last year.such plastics were  around bali, harming marine life.   ms perez also said she agreed with calls for coca cola to reach its environmental goals sooner than 2030 - although she would not say  whether she would step down if the plans failed. \"we have to reach this goal and we will - there's no question.\""
