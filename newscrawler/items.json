woman made her fortune through exploiting her own country, and corruption.isabel dos santos got access to lucrative deals involving land, oil, diamonds and telecoms when her father was president of angola, a southern african country rich in natural resources.the documents show how she and her husband were allowed to buy valuable state assets in a series of suspicious deals.ms dos santos says the allegations against her are entirely false and a politically motivated witch-hunt by the angolan government.the former president's daughter has made the uk her home and owns expensive properties in central london.she is already under criminal investigation by the authorities in angola for corruption and her assets in the country have been frozen.now bbc panorama has been given access to more than 700,000 leaked documents about the billionaire's business empire.most were obtained by the platform to protect whistle-blowers in africa and shared with the  (icij).they've been investigated by 37 media organisations including the guardian and portugal's l'espresso newspaper.andrew feinstein, the head of corruption watch, says the documents show how ms dos santos exploited her country at the expense of ordinary angolans.\"every time she appears on the cover of some glossy magazine somewhere in the world, every time that she hosts one of her glamorous parties in the south of france, she is doing so by trampling on the aspirations of the citizens of angola.\"the icij have called the documents the luanda leaks.one of the most suspicious deals was run from london through a uk subsidiary of the angolan state oil company sonangol.ms dos santos had been put in charge of the struggling sonangol in 2016, thanks to a presidential decree from her father jose eduardo dos santos, who kept a tight grip on his country for the 38 years he was in power.but when he retired as president in september 2017 her position was soon under threat, even though his hand-picked successor came from the same party. ms dos santos was sacked two months later.many angolans have been surprised at the way that president joao louren\u00e7o has gone after the business interests of his predecessor's family.the leaked documents show that as she left sonangol, ms dos santos approved $58m of suspicious payments to a consultancy company in dubai called matter business solutions.she says she has no financial interest in matter, but the leaked documents reveal it was run by her business manager and owned by a friend.panorama understands that matter sent more than 50 invoices to sonangol in london on the day that she was fired.ms dos santos appears to have approved payments to her friend's company after she was sacked.although some consultancy work had been carried out by matter, there's very little detail on the invoices to justify such large bills. one asks for \u20ac472,196 for unspecified expenses, another asks for $928,517 for unspecified legal services.two of the invoices - each for \u20ac676,339.97  - are for exactly the same work on the same date and ms dos santos signed them both off anyway.lawyers for matter business solutions say it was brought in to help restructure the oil industry in angola, and that the invoices were for work that had already been carried out by other consultancy companies it had hired. \"regarding the invoices related with expenses, it is common for consultancy companies to add expenses to invoices as a general item. this is often due to those expenses involving large amounts of paperwork... matter can produce documentary evidence to confirm all expenses incurred.\"ms dos santos's lawyers said her actions with regard to the matter payments were entirely lawful and that she had not authorised payments after she had been dismissed from sonangol.they said: \"all invoices paid were in relation to services contracted and agreed between the two parties, under a contract that was approved with the full knowledge and approval of the sonangol board of directors.\"the icij and panorama have also uncovered new details about the business deals that made ms dos santos rich.much of her fortune is based on her ownership of a stake in the portuguese energy company galp, which one of her companies bought from sonangol in 2006. the documents show it only had to pay 15% of the price upfront and that the remaining \u20ac63m ($70m) was turned into a low-interest loan from sonangol.under the generous terms of the loan, her debt to the angolan people didn't have to be repaid for 11 years.her stake in galp is now worth more than \u20ac750m.ms dos santos's company did offer to repay the sonangol loan in 2017.the repayment offer should have been rejected because it didn't include almost \u20ac9m of interest owing. but ms dos santos was in charge of sonangol at the time and she accepted the money as full payment of her own debt.she was fired six days later and the payment was returned by the new sonangol management.ms dos santos says she initiated the purchase of the stake in galp, and that sonangol made money from the deal as well.\"there's absolutely no wrongdoing in any of those transactions. this investment is the investment that in history has generated the most benefit for the national oil company and all the contracts that were drafted are perfectly legal contracts, there are no wrongdoings.\" her lawyers say the repayment offer in 2017 covered what sonangol had indicated was owed.it's a similar story in the diamond industry.ms dos santos's husband, sindika dokolo, signed a one-sided agreement in 2012 with angolan state diamond company sodiam.they were supposed to be 50-50 partners in a deal to buy a stake in the swiss luxury jeweller de grisogono.but it was funded by the state company. the documents show that 18 months after the deal, sodiam had put $79m into the partnership, while mr dokolo had only invested $4m. sodiam also awarded him a \u20ac5m success fee for brokering the deal, so he didn't have to use any of his own money.the diamond deal gets even worse for the angolan people.the documents reveal how sodiam borrowed all the cash from a private bank in which ms dos santos is the biggest shareholder.sodiam has to pay 9% interest and the loan was guaranteed by a presidential decree from her father, so ms dos santos's bank cannot lose out.bravo da rosa, the new chief executive of sodiam, told panorama that the angolan people hadn't got a single dollar back from the deal: \"in the end, when we have finished paying back this loan, sodiam will have lost more than $200m.\"the former president also gave ms dos santos's husband the right to buy some of angola's raw diamonds.the angolan government says the diamonds were sold at a knockdown price and sources have told panorama that almost $1bn may have been lost. ms dos santos told the bbc she couldn't comment because she was not a shareholder of de grisogono.but the leaked documents show that she is described as a shareholder of de grisogono by her own financial advisers.mr dokolo did put in some money later. his lawyers say he invested $115m and that the takeover of de grisogono was his idea. they say his company paid above the market rate for the raw diamonds.the leaked documents also reveal how ms dos santos bought land from the state in september 2017. once again she only had to pay a small up-front fee.her company bought a square kilometre of prime beachfront land in the capital luanda with the help of presidential decrees signed by her father.the contract says the land was worth $96m, but the documents show her company paid only 5% of that after agreeing to invest the rest in the development.panorama traced some of the ordinary angolans who were evicted to make way for the futungo development.they've been moved from the luandan seafront to an isolated housing development 30 miles (50km) from the capital.teresa vissapa lost her business to ms dos santos' development and is now struggling to bring up her seven children.she said: \"i only ask god to make her think a little more about our situation. maybe she doesn't even know it, but we are suffering.\"ms dos santos declined to comment on the futungo development.but it was not the only land deal involving ms dos santos that displaced the local population.about 500 families were evicted from another stretch of the luandan seafront after isabel dos santos got involved in another major redevelopment project.the families are now living in desperate conditions next to an open sewer. some of their shacks are flooded with sewage whenever the tide rises.ms dos santos says there weren't any evictions linked to her project and that her companies were never paid because the development was cancelled. the billionaire has also made big profits from the telecoms industry in angola.she acquired a 25% stake in the country's biggest mobile phone provider, unitel. it was granted a telecoms licence by her father in 1999 and she bought her stake the following year from a high ranking government official.unitel has already paid her $1bn in dividends and her stake is worth another $1bn. but that's not the only way she got cash from the private company.she arranged for unitel to lend \u20ac350m to a new company she set up, called unitel international holdings.the company name was misleading because it wasn't connected to unitel and ms dos santos was the owner. the documents show ms dos santos signed off on the loans as both lender and borrower, which is a blatant conflict of interest.ms dos santos denied that the loans were corrupt. she said: \"this loan had both directors' approval and shareholders' approval, and it's a loan that will generate, and has generated, benefit for unitel.\"her lawyers say the loans protected unitel from currency fluctuations.most of the companies involved in the dodgy deals were overseen by accountants working for the financial services company, price waterhouse coopers (pwc). it's made millions providing auditing, consultancy and tax advice to her companies. but pwc has terminated its relationship with the billionaire and her family, after panorama questioned the way the company had assisted ms dos santos in the deals that had made her rich.pwc says it is holding an inquiry into the \"very serious and concerning allegations\".tom keatinge, director of the centre for financial crime and security studies, told panorama that pwc had given legitimacy to ms dos santos and her companies.\"pwc, if not facilitating the corruption, are providing a veneer of respectability that makes what's happening acceptable or more acceptable than it might otherwise be.\"so if i was at pwc i'd be conducting a pretty thorough audit of what decisions were made, and in hindsight actually: 'did we make the wrong decision to accept this business and should we have reported what we had been presented with?'\"pwc says it strives to maintain the highest professional standards and has set expectations for consistent ethical behaviour across its global network.\"in response to the very serious and concerning allegations that have been raised, we immediately initiated an investigation and are working to thoroughly evaluate the facts and conclude our inquiry.  \"we will not hesitate to take appropriate actions to ensure that we always stand for the very highest standards of behaviour, wherever we operate in the world.\""}, "1": {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-51155271", "author": "Unknown", "title": "the rescue worker who refuses to leave a

company. these days the only counting he does is of people he rescues from piles of rubble. many of them have been caught in air strikes, carried out by syrian or russian bombers, after returning to retrieve valuables from their abandoned homes.laith's wife and two young children are among those who have left. he says he's seen too many deaths to risk allowing them to stay.\"now they are far from me and we sometimes talk via video calls. i do miss them a lot but i'm also relieved that they're not exposed to the same danger as i am,\" he adds.laith's first loss was his younger brother, mohammed, who died after being injured in an air strike in 2012, despite laith's frantic efforts to rescue him. it was his very first shift with the civil defence volunteers known as the white helmets.\"i helped pull my brother out of the rubble and managed to get him to hospital, but he died a few hours later. he was just 22. it happened during the first intensive spell of bombing we experienced here in saraqeb,\" he says.you might have thought that the experience would have put laith off continuing to work with the white helmets, yet it seems to have had the opposite effect.\"after that there were several even heavier air strikes and many people here needed help. knowing this was the case motivated me to do all i could for them. this helped ease the deep grief i felt after losing my brother,\" he says.laith recalls one rescue operation in 2015, a time when pro-assad forces had only recently begun dropping on the town what have become known as barrel bombs - barrel-shaped explosive devices packed with nails or other metal fragments. capable of burying people in their homes, they also send large quantities of lethal shrapnel flying through the air, often injuring large numbers of civilians.\"i remember digging in the rubble with my bare hands for hours trying to rescue an old lady who was trapped in her basement. i could hear her cries but couldn't see her at first. but finally we got her out alive,\" he says. is a reporter for bbc radio 4 - read some of his other stories about syria:another more recent success also sticks in his mind.\"i managed with the help of other members of my team to pull a nine-year-old girl called islam out of piles of rubble,\" laith says. \"she was finding it hard to breathe and under so much masonry that it was touch and go, but i'm delighted to say that she survived.\"after one recent bombing raid, laith was photographed emerging from the wreckage of a university laboratory with the body of a young female science student in his arms. but this story did not end well.\"this case was a very memorable one that i don't think i will ever forget,\" laith says. \"her name was abir. she was still alive when i gathered her in my arms and ran from the lab. she had been close to graduating and you can see me desperately screaming for help outside the building. \"all around i could hear the sounds of ambulances racing to help people and the screams of those who were injured, but all of them were full already and couldn't take her. she died right there as i held her.\"before the war began in 2011, saraqeb was a thriving agricultural town, a transport hub for the villages of southern idlib.\"all sorts of people would either come here for our markets or pass through saraqeb en route to other places. we even had a few tourists,\" laith says. \"the town was always full of life, laughter and vitality. it was such a busy, happy place. now it's a silent, empty shell of a town.\"fuel for transport is in short supply and there's little in the way of electricity or wood to heat peoples' homes.\"people are having to look for anything they can make a fire with. they're even burning things they hold dear like their furniture and clothes, as well as valuables that they won't be able to take with them if forced to flee the town,\" laith says.given saraqeb's position near the front line in southern idlib it is likely to be among the first towns to fall if the renewed ground and air offensive by pro-syrian government forces proves successful. scores of formerly opposition-held villages in the region have fallen in recent weeks and syrian president bashar al-assad has repeatedly pledged to retake every inch of the province. the thought that laith may soon have to join the hundreds of thousands of other people in idlib who have been forced to flee their homes, deeply distresses him.\"i've always lived in saraqeb and i dearly hope i won't be forced to leave it. it's my life, it's my soul it's everything,\" he says. \"in the end it will all come down to international deals and agreements over which i have no say, but i hope that one day the town will return to what it was before. that's my deepest wish.\"you may also be interested in:eleven-year-old israa trekked more than 2,000 miles (3,000km) with her family to northern europe after their home in syria was destroyed. they

", "article_text": "microbiologist frank plummer has been on the frontlines of the battle against of some of the world's most alarming epidemics, from hiv to ebola - but his illustrious career masked a growing reliance on alcohol. now, the researcher has become the guinea pig in a clinical trial investigating whether brain implants can help treat alcohol use disorder. alcohol was always a big part of frank plummer's life. at the beginning of his research career, in the early 1980s in nairobi, he began to lean on scotch to relax, and to the handle stress, disappointment and grief related to his work. he and his colleagues were feeling the visceral urgency of their work as they watched the african hiv crisis unfold. \"i felt just like a fire fighter or something but the fire didn't go out,\" mr plummer, 67, told the bbc. \"it just kept going and going and going. there was this sense that you needed to do something and that the world needed to do something. and i was trying to draw attention to it and get money to continue our work. so it was a time of intense pressure.\" mr plummer's research subjects were kenyan women, sex workers, some who were found to have a natural immunity to the virus. it was pioneering research, and over the 17 years mr plummer spent in kenya, he and his colleagues made groundbreaking discoveries made about how hiv spreads - breakthroughs that have helped inform how we reduce transmission risk and that raised the possibility a vaccine against the virus could be developed one day. in those stressful times, five or six glasses of scotch a night were giving him room to exhale after hectic days and weeks. when he returned to canada, he took a leadership position at winnipeg's national microbiology laboratory, one of a handful of laboratories in the world with the capacity to work with highly pathogenic viruses like ebola. at the lab they dealt with the outbreaks of sars in 2003 and the h1n1 influenza in 2009. it was there mr plummer contributed to the development of canada's ebola vaccine.it was vital, exciting, and stressful work, with 12-hour days that began with coffee and would end with several glasses of scotch. his drinking escalated to about 20 ounces of the booze a night.it didn't seem to affect his work - until 2012, when it caught up with him. \"my liver packed it in,\" he says. \"before that i knew i drank a lot but i didn't think i had a problem.\"the diagnosis of chronic liver failure was followed by a liver transplant. he had to watch his alcohol intake to preserve his new liver - but he found his alcohol had become a powerful thirst. mr plummer tried treatment - rehab programmes, support groups, counselling, medications - but any relief was temporary.  he would inevitably slip back into drinking.  \"it was pretty hopeless cycle and it was very tough on my family and my wife, jo, and on my children and my stepchildren,\" he says. \"i was in the hospital a lot, i almost died several times.\" he went looking for help - \"a more robust clinical solution, perhaps one not yet discovered\" - and was referred to two neurosurgeons at toronto's sunnybrook hospital. they were recruiting patients for an experimental procedure being conducted in north america for the first time, using deep brain stimulation (dbs) to help patients with treatment-resistant alcohol use disorder. the surgical trial is testing how safe and effective dbs is for alcohol addiction. dbs has been used for over 25 years to help treat movement disorders like parkinson's disease. roughly 200,000 dbs surgeries have been performed around the world, many for the nervous system disorder.in recent years, it's been explored as a treatment for a range of other diseases. at sunnybrook, clinical trials are underway exploring dbs for use in disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, and alcohol use disorder. what changes is the part of the brain being targeted, says dr nir lipsman, the trial lead investigator and the neurosurgeon who performed mr plummer's surgery. \"[for] things like parkinson's disease we target motor circuits in the brain, in addiction, alcohol use disorder, we're targeting reward, pleasure circuits of the brain,\" he says.  dbs treatment involves implanting an electrical device directly into a patient's brain to stimulate circuits where there is abnormal activity , or dysfunctional \"wiring\", and help reset them. dbs is frequently described as a type of \"pacemaker\" for the brain.  electrodes are inserted into a targeted region of the brain to recalibrate activity in that area using electrical impulses - controlled by a pacemaker-like device placed under the skin of the patient's chest - and ease cravings. mr plummer was the trial's first patient and underwent the experimental surgery just over a year ago. a total of six people are expected to eventually participate - all with a history of chronic alcohol use disorder proven resistant to other types of treatment. patients are awake for the surgery. mr plummer says the worst part of the procedure were the noise and vibrations when surgeons drilled into his skull in order to implant the electrodes. \"it was a large drill that drills about a 25 cent piece out of your skull on both sides - that wasn't painful but it was annoying,\" he says. the brain pleasure centres being targeted in this study - the nucleus accumbens - is also involved in mood, anxiety and depression. that factor is potentially key since many addiction disorders frequently coexist with mood disorders, the neurosurgeon says. the surgeon says mr plummer has seen an improvement in both his cravings and his mood. in those who've had the surgery, \"we are seeing some signs, some early signs that we are having an impact on those kind of behaviours and those kind of measures that we want to influence\", says dr lipsman.the surgeons hope the study will shift some of the stigma around addiction disorders. addictions are still often seen as a weakness or a failure of willpower, which can prevent people seeking treatment. \"we need to change the way we view addiction, change the way we view alcohol use disorder as a condition in its advanced stages, in the treatment resistant stages as being driven by circuits in the brain that are not functioning properly,\" he says.  but he cautions the research is in early stages - and that it's not a silver bullet. \"it's not just put in the implant, say goodbye and you're done,\" he says. patients should still continue their conventional treatment for their alcohol addictions, like therapy or rehab programmes. \"it's really about viewing this as part of a larger strategy to treat what is an incredibly complex and challenging condition.\" any results from dbs are not instantaneous - it can take weeks to feel a change. for mr plummer, after a little while, \"life just became so much better, so much richer.\"  \"i suddenly decided that i wanted to write a book about my experiences as a scientist, and experiences living in kenya,\" he says.he's back to getting up early, writes daily and has returned to hiv research with the hopes of developing a vaccine for the disease. he drinks occasionally but says he doesn't have the same compulsion or the physical dependency as before. \"life is on the table again,\" he says.

\"for me, mr matzneff is abject. we all know how some girls can become besotted by men with a certain literary aura,\" says bombardier. \"some older men like to attract little children with sweets. mr matzneff does it with his reputation.\" looking back today, what denise bombardier recalls most about the exchange is the scathing reception she then got from the paris literary in-crowd. she had been warned by her publisher that attacking matzneff would not go down well - and so it proved.in newspaper articles she was described as \"frustrated\" and a \"bitch\" (the french is even more obscene). \"so (bombardier) has discovered that in the year 1990 girls of 15 make love to men who are 30 years older than they are! well, big deal!\" wrote one critic.it is a measure of the extraordinary rapidity of moral change in our times that none of this could conceivably happen today.by no stretch of the imagination could a contemporary author write so blithely of his seduction of underage girls - and, in matzneff's case, of boys too. and even if he did, there would certainly be no-one leaping to his defence, accusing his detractors - like they accused bombardier 30 years ago - of reactionary neo-puritanism and failing to understand the wellsprings of teenage sexuality. and yet just a generation ago, evidently, the idea of sex between adult men and adolescent girls was not only not shocking - in \"enlightened\" circles, that is. more than that, it was seen as liberating for the youngsters themselves - a final casting off of the sexual bonds imposed by the old pre-1968 order.  in retrospect, though it did not seem that way at the time, the apostrophe programme was a turning point. denise bombardier may have been vilified in 1990 for attacking a french literary treasure - admired by president fran\u00e7ois mitterrand no less - but in fact she represented the future.matzneff, who had appeared five times previously on apostrophe, was never invited back. gradually his star faded. there was growing distaste for his sexual predilections, and before this latest controversy he was an all-but-forgotten figure outside the left bank.but in 2020 the moral compass had shifted 180 degrees. what had been seduction was now abuse.what matzneff saw as a celebration of sexual adventure with partners who, though young, were always consenting, had become an evil power game.   and when publishing executive vanessa springora brought out a book this month describing the traumatic effects of her own relationship - aged 14 - with matzneff, it was clear that he was now a literary non-person.matzneff's books have been blacklisted and a criminal investigation is under way, though given the many years that have passed it will almost certainly not lead to charges. in france the age of \"sexual majority\" is 15.  if an adult has sex with a person under 15 he or she will face prosecution, though not necessarily for rape.\"at the age of 14 you are not supposed to have a 50-year-old man waiting for you when you come out of school; nor to share a hotel room with him and find yourself in his bed... when you should be having your tea,\" writes springora in consent. we all think differently now, so today there is no-one who will take up the cudgels for matzneff. by universal consent his behaviour was unacceptable. the other people in his \"seductions\" also existed and their story is now being told. but it is instructive to look back at that 1990 apostrophe programme - and indeed at matzneff's five previous appearances in the 1970s and '80s.     never did he make the slightest secret of his taste for the under-aged. his 1975 appearance was for a book called \"the under-16s\", for goodness sake.and up until denise bombardier, no-one said a thing.

What's it like to spend every night on the lower decks?", "article_text": "for more than two decades after his asylum application was rejected, sunny found a safe haven aboard the buses that zigzag across london at night. what's it like to spend every night on the lower decks?sunny waits patiently, wind penetrating his well-worn jacket and the winter cold biting at his extremities.it's past midnight and his legs are weary but he stands firm and smiles as the bus lunges to a halt, its wing mirror clipping overgrown branches on its way. he moves aside to let other passengers board, greets the familiar face of the driver with a gentle bow of the head and taps his weathered oyster card on the payment point.relieved at finding his favoured spot at the back of the lower deck empty, he slides into place and gets comfortable for the long ride ahead. sunny hugs his bag to his stomach, feels his wrinkled hands start to thaw, and closes his eyes.leaving behind the smell of fried chicken and noise of london's late-night traffic, his mind drifts.he sees his younger self, kneeling in prayer between the concrete walls of a nigerian prison, waiting to be executed. his offence: struggling for democracy.a guard barges into the cell, lifts him to his feet and rushes him down silent corridors, out into blinding sunlight, where a car is waiting. family and friends have bought his freedom, paying off everyone from the prison officials to the air hostess on the flight to london.sunny is jerked back to the present as a scrum of drunken men, singing tunelessly, trail through the doors and up to the top deck. it must be three or four in the morning, he calculates - the usual hour for trouble.around this time, sunny often notices three distinct groups around him. it's a neat survey of modern london. there are those who came to this country for a better life, rushing to their pre-dawn cleaning jobs. another group - mostly indigenous britons - heads home from the nightclubs, talking loudly and cramming down fast food. and finally there are the homeless, those who have nowhere else to go, for whom buses are a place to rest.sunny doesn't resent the others; he has learned to enjoy their boisterousness. when they smile, he smiles. when they laugh, he laughs too. it's amazing how a few pints can evaporate class boundaries, stripping reserved englishmen of their inhibitions so they chat with the homeless as temporary equals.sunny tries to recall the last time he felt as happy as these drunken men.perhaps it was when his asylum claim was still under review. back then he was full of gratitude for his second chance at life. he took a course in documentary-making, choosing to report on the lives of london's homeless, never imagining he would soon be in their shoes. sunny had dared to hope for a bright future, safe under the protection of her majesty the queen - that figurehead familiar from sun-faded colonial posters across nigeria. but his request for asylum was refused.that left him with two options: go home to a country under , where his death sentence would finally be carried out, or go underground.it wasn't a difficult choice.and so began 21 years as a nomad on london's buses, which sunny quickly realised were safer and warmer than the streets.it was a church minister, a woman of unwavering generosity, who first bought him a monthly pass to save him multiple nightly fares. she continued to do so, month after month, and other friends would chip in if she wasn't around.by day sunny would volunteer at churches - he would attend several during his time in london. when his work was done, he would often head to westminster reference library where he could catch up on the day's news or pick up where he'd left off in the book he'd been reading.he might then ask a restaurant manager if they could spare some food, and says he was rarely turned away. but no later than 9pm he would invariably be stepping aboard a bus for the first of three, maybe four, nightly trips across the capital.he soon discovered the best buses for a good rest. there was the trusty n29, from trafalgar square to the northern suburb of wood green. but the 25 - which ran 24 hours - offered the longest uninterrupted sleep. in traffic, it would take two hours to get from central london to ilford, in essex, where - if he was really lucky - a driver might take pity and leave him sleeping on board at the terminus.more often, the homeless passengers - maybe four or five of them - would be woken and turfed off until the next driver arrived.most were destitute women, british or african, who used the bus as a sanctuary from the threat of sexual assault. laden with bags, they would be grateful for sunny's help lugging them on and off the bus.sunny always travelled light. a small tote bag allowed him to avoid the stigma of homelessness during daylight hours. some homeless folk would stretch out across seats but he preferred not to inconvenience other riders.it took a while to learn all the tricks. at first he hadn't worried about where to sit. but then he found himself in a confrontation with two men who had been trying to set light to the hair of an unsuspecting woman in front. he chased them off but resolved to avoid conflict where possible.the lower deck, he concluded, was the preserve of reasonable people, of families and the elderly. trouble rarely erupted so close to the driver. the back seats were optimal, not just for the head rest but for peace of mind.but there were always distractions: the lurching bus, the neon lights, the noisy night-riders and the humming engine. two hours of proper sleep across an entire night was an achievement. at dawn - or when he got hungry, whichever came first - he would head to a mcdonald's. he never begged but friendly staff at the leicester square branch would give him food and let him shave in the bathrooms. fellow customers could be kind, too. or, if he timed it right, he could hop off at the 24-hour branch in haringey - halfway along the n29 route. there, he could enjoy a peace that was rare in the central london branches, rest his head on a table and continue his slumber.for a handful of christmases, sunny broke his routine and tried winter night shelters provided by churches.seven different churches worked a rota. but they were scattered in different locations across the capital, creating a daily exodus of people - the \"walking dead\", in his words - trying to reach their next bed before the evening curfew.sunny came to realise he preferred the bus to lying on stone floors, packed shoulder-to-shoulder. it was hard to sleep through the smell of tobacco, alcohol and unwashed bodies. and, of course, the screams of the others as they lay there tormented by nightmares.from the seats of london buses, sunny watched the changing face of the capital. slowly, the white population declined as a proportion of the total. the ranks of the homeless expanded.in this most diverse of spaces, he became adept at matching faces or dialects to places of origin. and he developed a sixth sense for trouble, detecting warning signs in gestures: the smirk of trouble-making teens, the pursed lips of an explosive racist. there were combinations that could result in confrontation: drunken football fans and a veiled woman; tired commuters and people using speakerphone; gang members and their local rivals. in the months following the brexit referendum of 2016, hostility to migrants seemed to become more commonplace. \"go back home,\" became a regular refrain.sunny didn't blame the british government for his predicament. had his own country's not been so bad, he wouldn't have been here in the first place.eventually, the refugee centre at notre dame de france church, off leicester square, made an application for leave to remain on his behalf. if people prove they have continuously lived in the uk for 20 years, they can qualify to settle. but sunny had spent that time avoiding all records, evading detection. how could he demonstrate he had been there all this time?\"i understand that your client is currently homeless, but we still require documentary evidence to show continuous residence from 1995 to the present date,\" said a letter from the home office. \"evidence such as utility bills, bank statements, tenancy agreements\u2026\"sunny asked the friendliest bus drivers to write him a letter of support. one obliged, confirming he was \"a regular rider throughout the night\".the churches he had volunteered at over the years provided supporting statements and dug out old photographs recording his presence at charity events.these days sunny is the one taking pictures. he reaches inside his bag for the disposable camera he's been given to tell his story as part of a photography project.there are a few frames left. lifting the viewfinder to his eye, sunny pushes firm against the flash button and pauses to adjust his composition. click\u2026 he releases the shutter.the photograph will not simply show rows of mostly empty seats on the lower deck of a bus. it will be a picture of life as a free man.at the age of 55, in 2017, sunny was granted leave to remain. it had taken a year but finally he had the right to shelter, to work, to exist. and he was thankful.it is almost his stop, deep in south london's suburbs - he still isn't used to travelling to a destination. even now he sometimes sleeps on buses, though more often during the day rather than at night. for so long a sanctuary, they remain a place to empty his mind - their familiarity a comfort.sunny's knees click as he hoists himself up. he's getting older, his struggle has aged him beyond his years. he thanks the driver and carefully steps down to the pavement. leaning into the breeze, he walks towards his bedsit, smiling as the cold cracks his lips.in 2017, freelance writer tom de castella noticed an elderly woman and her son living on a bench in south london. he discovered they had already been there for two years\u2026 which was puzzling. why hadn't anyone done anything to help them? why did everyone accept it as normal? the more he investigated, the stranger it seemed."}, "6": {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51166592", "author": "Unknown", "title": "harry and meghan's future: your questions answered", "date": "19 January 2020", "story_body": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will no longer use their HRH titles and will not receive public funds for royal duties, ", "article_text": "the duke and duchess of sussex will no longer use their hrh titles and will not receive public funds for royal duties, here we answer some of the questions we have received from readers about what this means.prince harry and meghan have said they will no longer use their hrh titles.from this spring, they will become known as harry, duke of sussex, and meghan, duchess of sussex.prince harry will remain a prince, having been born one.yes, his position in the line of succession will not change.the statement from buckingham palace said the duke and duchess will continue to maintain their private patronages and associations \"with the queen's blessing\".harry holds 16 patronages, according to the sussex royal website -

chinatown and the gay village. beyond that, you come to a stretch of road bordered by nightclubs - factory, fifth, joshua brooks - a big part of the city's vibrant nightlife.  with its close proximity to two of the city's universities, the road is also a popular area for student accommodation. reynhard sinaga, a 36-year-old postgraduate student, had made this his home for more than seven years, living in a rented flat just a few moments' walk from factory nightclub.sinaga, originally from indonesia, was a perpetual student. he already had four degrees and was studying for a doctorate. by night he was a serial sex offender. he has been found guilty of drugging, raping and sexually assaulting 48 men, but police believe they are among at least 190 victims. they are able to be so precise about these numbers because sinaga filmed his attacks and collected what detectives call \"trophies\" - items or information stolen from his victims.sinaga typically approached his victims in the street. the rapist operated in a small area surrounding his flat. his targets were men mostly in their late teens or early 20s who had been out drinking, often in the nearby nightclubs.some were on their way home, others had become separated from friends.many were too drunk to remember their conversation with sinaga, but for those who did there was no indication of a sexual motive. sinaga used various pretexts to entice each to his flat.some victims could recall being provided with a drink and then blacking out. has support and more information on emotional distressgreater manchester police said anyone who believes they might have been attacked by sinaga can  or call its police line on 0800 092 0410 from inside the uk or 0207 158 0124 from abroad.the force said anyone in need of support from specialist agencies could call 0800 056 0154 from within the uk or 0207 158 0011 from abroad.sinaga presented himself as a flamboyant, churchgoing academic who used the nickname \"posh spice\". a thin man of slight build and short stature, physically he appeared unthreatening. several victims recall him smiling a lot. it was this apparent harmlessness that enabled sinaga to pose as a \"good samaritan\", coaxing men he approached back to the flat. we know about the benign impression sinaga created because dozens of victims gave testimony to police, with 48 of them appearing in court over the course of four trials.of the victims who went to court, the vast majority were heterosexual. ian rushton, from the crown prosecution service, said he thought sinaga took \"a particular pleasure in preying on heterosexual men\".most of his victims were living in manchester at the time and, in all, 26 were students when they were attacked.their accounts explain how sinaga operated.one was waiting for his girlfriend outside fifth avenue nightclub - since renamed fifth manchester - when he was approached by a \"small asian guy\" who seemed harmless.the man was invited back to sinaga's flat to wait for his girlfriend, but recalled nothing further after being given a shot of clear liquid to drink.another man described being \"approached by a young asian gentleman\". he said he had a \"vague recollection of explaining that my phone was dead and that i was trying to get a taxi but the taxis were passing me\".he added: \"i think i can recall a conversation along the lines of, 'would you like to come inside and charge your phone and have a quick chat,'\" he told the court.to him, sinaga \"didn't seem like an imposing character\" and during their conversations in the apartment, he appeared to be \"an honest, motivated person\" with an interest in academic research.the man told the court that soon after being offered a drink, he couldn't remember \"a single thing until the next morning\".after waking, confused and disoriented, he left within five minutes.like almost every victim, he had no idea he had been raped until being approached by police.another victim remembered his friends putting him in a cab outside a club. his next recollection was waking up in a strange apartment.when he asked sinaga what had happened, he described providing care and shelter after finding him lying in the street.another victim believed sinaga had been \"really nice and had looked after him\".one victim, a teenage university student, managed to get sinaga's mobile number as a precaution after waking up in the flat, and then having concerns that something might have been stolen from him.when he rang to ask for more information about what happened, sinaga described himself as a \"good samaritan\" who had found him unconscious on the pavement.another man remembered waking up on the floor, covered in a blanket, before thanking the flat's occupier for letting him stay over.he suspected nothing, even though the person \"refused to give me personal details\" in order to assist with an insurance claim for a lost mobile phone.the phone, like many others stolen from their owners, was later recovered from sinaga's home by police.some victims felt incredibly unwell after regaining consciousness, sometimes naked and covered in vomit.unknown to them at the time, sinaga had given his victims a drug - almost certainly ghb - which rendered them unconscious before he assaulted them. one victim, who woke up naked on sinaga's floor feeling nauseous and panic-stricken, came to the conclusion he had been drugged, telling his fianc\u00e9 about that suspicion but not about the condition in which he awoke. another man, who was told he could sleep on the floor, recalled waking twice during the night, on one occasion to be sick.he remembered that on one of the occasions he was unable to move his arms and could feel himself being penetrated, before passing out again.in the morning, he briefly spoke with sinaga before leaving. he did not report what happened to police, until being approached by them.it was the largest rape investigation in uk history.police found more than 100 of the men from clues in sinaga's flat. but the identities of 70 men have not been established and police are now appealing for anyone who believes they may been abused by sinaga to come forward.the cps's ian rushton says that sinaga is probably the most prolific known rapist \"anywhere in the world\".one of four children, sinaga comes from a wealthy indonesian family who live in depok, a city within the jakarta metropolitan area. his father is a banker and also a prominent businessman in the palm oil sector.after obtaining a degree in architecture at the university of indonesia in depok, he moved to the uk in 2007 to study urban planning at the university of manchester.he went on to gain three degrees there before embarking on a doctorate in human geography at the university of leeds - travelling there from manchester when required. his family wealth meant that he rarely worked, although he claims to have had stints in employment in hospitality at both manchester football clubs and in a clothes shop. manchester united have since said they have no record of him working at the club. he worked for a period at a bar in the city's gay village, the area where he spent much of his time socialising. he was also a regular at a local church.after originally living in student accommodation, sinaga moved to a rented flat in montana house on princess street in 2011. while his convictions cover a period of two and a half years, police believe his offences predate 2015. but they say they may never know the true extent of his crimes. it came to an end in the summer of 2017.sinaga was offending with abandon, sometimes night after night. in footage recovered from cctv cameras covering his block of flats, he is seen leaving one evening only to return with a man 60 seconds later. it was just after midnight on 2 june 2017, when he approached his final victim.a teenager, who left the factory nightclub to get some fresh air after becoming separated from friends, agreed to go to sinaga's flat after it was suggested he could try to contact them from there.the man recalled nothing further until waking several hours later being sexually attacked by sinaga.he immediately pushed sinaga away, who responded by screaming \"intruder\" and \"help\", before repeatedly biting the teenager.the man hit sinaga several times, escaped from the flat, and then called police, who arrived to a chaotic scene.sinaga, who was discovered semi-conscious with serious injuries, was at first viewed sympathetically, and the teenager was arrested for assault.but sinaga's behaviour in hospital began to arouse suspicion. he kept asking officers to have a mobile phone brought to him from his flat. police asked him to confirm the pin number before they would hand it over. however sinaga gave a series of false numbers, then tried to grab the phone after providing the correct one.the officer became so suspicious that he seized the phone as potential evidence and, when it was checked, a video recording was found of sinaga raping the arrested teenager.it was the start of what the officer overseeing the investigation, assistant chief constable mabs hussain, calls \"an absolutely unprecedented case\".he says the inquiry has been like \"piecing a jigsaw together without the picture\".another of sinaga's mobiles had somehow ended up in the pocket of the final victim.between them, the two phones had been used to capture about 800 videos of sinaga raping or sexually assaulting unconscious men.the victims, usually snoring loudly, were often repeatedly raped over several hours.in some of the films, sinaga is seen to forcibly hold men down who, though unconscious, were visibly distressed or made attempts to push him away. in others, victims are seen to vomit while being attacked.to find the men, detectives used both the films and \"trophies\" collected by sinaga - phones, watches, id cards from their wallets, images that sinaga had downloaded from their social media profiles, searches about them he conducted online.when they lacked identifying information, investigators tried facial recognition technology, approached local universities, and asked other police forces around the uk if they knew any of the men.officers also considered whether sinaga might have killed any of his victims with fatal drug overdoses, examining potential links to unsolved deaths or missing people, but there was no evidence to suggest this was the case.when officers made a positive identification, that person would be approached and told he had been a victim of sexual offences.lisa waters, of the st mary's sexual assault referral centre, says their crisis workers accompanied detectives on these visits in order to \"offer immediate emotional and practical support\".she says that being told what happened \"can be quite overwhelming, very confusing\".\"what we didn't want to do was to drop the bombshell and then just disappear and leave these men with no support,\" she says.a large programme was put in place to provide ongoing support.waters says many of the men have chosen not to tell anybody else about what happened to them.\"that might be because they might want to protect their own psychological health; it might be because they're ashamed to tell other people; it might be because they're fearful of other people's responses,\" she says.dozens of those approached did not want to go through the court process.sinaga was found to have told unsuspecting friends about some of the rapes, passing them off as consensual sexual conquests.in messages about the first victim who went to court, sinaga boasted about the attack on new year's eve in 2014.\"i didn't get my new year kiss, but i've had my first sex in 2015 already,\" he wrote, adding that the man was \"straight in 2014. 2015 is his breakthrough to the gay world hahaha\".during another boast about what he presented as his prowess with \"straight\" men, sinaga wrote: \"take a sip of my secret poison, i'll make you fall in love.\"police officers have spoken to other men, tracked down as a result of still images discovered in the flat that date from before 2015. these men recall being there, but not what happened. there is no other evidence available to show that they were sexually assaulted.only one previous report to police was linked to sinaga after his arrest, dating from april 2017, when the victim had woken disorientated and unwell in a strange room with an asian male.he quickly left, but later that day had flashbacks of being sexually assaulted and - two days afterwards - he called the police.however, the man was unsure of the property in which he had been assaulted, meaning inquiries focused on two nearby hotels, neither of which had had any guests who matched the suspect's description.despite the overwhelming evidence, sinaga pleaded not guilty to all 159 charges, forcing a series of four trials in which his victims had to give evidence and jurors had to watch hours of distressing videos.court rules meant that nothing could be reported in the media and each jury was unaware of the wider case against him.sinaga gave evidence in the first and last of the trials, running what the judge called a \"ludicrous defence\" which involved him claiming that each victim had agreed to fulfil his \"sexual fantasy\" by being penetrated while being filmed and pretending to be asleep.when this scenario was suggested to one victim in court, he responded by saying it was \"absolutely farcical\".sinaga changed his story during the trials.in the first trial, he denied that the loud snoring heard in some films was snoring at all, insisting it was just \"breathing sounds\".but, by the time of the final trial, he claimed the snoring was actually just \"role-play\".it was only halfway through the first trial that he admitted penetrating most of the victims on that indictment.in the witness box he came across as vain and self-absorbed, telling jurors: \"i make myself available all the time\u2026 i may look like a 'lady boy' and it seems very popular amongst curious men who are looking for a gay experience.\"when entering and exiting court he often appeared cheerful, as if he was enjoying the process.in the absence of the jury, the judge repeatedly asked defence counsel whether any of the evidence could be agreed, to spare jurors watching every video.but sinaga would not agree and, because he insisted each victim was conscious and consenting, the videos had to be played to demonstrate this was a lie.the prosecution case was that sinaga used the drug ghb to incapacitate his victims.no trace of the drug was found in his apartment and - due to the circumstances of sinaga's arrest - the final victim was not tested quickly enough for its presence to be established.however, the symptoms shown by the hundreds of videos were all consistent with ghb intoxication, as were the descriptions of him providing clear liquid shots, and each trial heard expert evidence about its effects.ghb was used by stephen port, who murdered four men between june 2014 and september 2015. the men were given fatal overdoses of the drug. port was also convicted of raping or assaulting several living victims using ghb.the impact on sinaga's victims is vast.waters says that \"some of the men have found it very difficult to function in everyday life\".this has resulted in substance misuse, people unable to go to work, students unable to finish university, and others having to leave home after feeling unable to function any longer within their families.she adds that \"some men have been suicidal and we've had to try to help them come to terms with that and how we can make them safe\".dr sam warner, author of a report about the psychological impact on sinaga's victims, says a loss of power coupled with an absence of memory can be \"extremely frightening, disturbing, upsetting because that goes to the heart of how you make sense of yourself, how you understand your experiences\".\"in a situation where people have been incapacitated through drugs they may have no flashback to that particular event,\" she says.\"what they will have is the flashback to being told, however sensitively done, because suddenly they become a rape victim at that point.\"she says the stress and trauma \"may continue throughout people's lives\".in a series of statements read in court, the men themselves described the impact.\"i felt numb. i was totally shocked, embarrassed, betrayed and very angry,\" one said.\"his actions were disgusting, unforgiveable. he has massively abused my trust in humanity.\"another man said: \"i want sinaga to spend the rest of his life in prison. not only for what he has done to me but for what he has done to the other lads and the misery and stress he has caused them.\"a further victim said: \"i remember the day the police contacted me, it is a day i will never forget because it changed my life forever.\"another: \"i wish the worse for him, i want him to feel the pain and sufferance i have felt. he has destroyed a part of my life.\"throughout all four trials, sinaga displayed not a glimmer of empathy or contrition.his persistent smile, so often used to comfort and disarm, was instead revealed to be a mark of his cruelty.in a message to sinaga, one victim said: \"i'm not going to let you ruin my life.\""}, "10": {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51163865", "author": "Unknown", "title": "harry and meghan drop royal duties and hrh titles", "date": "19 January 2020", "story_body": "Prince Harry and Meghan will no longer use their HRH titles and will not receive public funds for royal duties, Buckingham Palace has announced.

one where perhaps harry and meghan continued with some royal duties, dividing their time equally between the uk and canada. but the contradictions and conflicts of interest were too many.there are still lots of details to thrash out. and the whole thing will be reviewed after a year. but a new life awaits harry and meghan - celebrities, certainly, but a different kind of royalty.  some questions about the couple's future status remain unanswered, including what their tax and immigration status will be in the uk and canada. it is not yet known whether meghan still intends to gain british citizenship, which would entail her spending a certain amount of time in the uk. while the couple intend to divide their time between the uk and canada, it is expected that they will spend the majority of their time in canada.former press secretary to the queen dickie arbiter said the new arrangement brings a crisis for the royal family to an acceptable conclusion.\"it's a win-win situation. it's the best sort of deal that they could have come up with, without totally upsetting the apple cart - although harry and meghan made a pretty good job of that with their bombshell announcement,\" he said.\"it's a workable situation and it's a situation that is going to be reviewed after a year which kind of indicates that the door might be just left ajar.\"but katie nicholl, vanity fair royal correspondent, said harry and meghan stepping away from royal duties was a loss for the institution.\"the sussexes have won because they've got what they want, which is independence from the royal family. i do think the royal family will have lost out. harry and meghan brought a very magical and unique brand to the royal family,\" she said.she said that the agreement could also pave the way for younger royals, however.\"prince charles wants a slimmed-down monarchy. maybe this is all in keeping with how the monarchy sees itself moving forward. if this works, if it's seen as a success, i think it could be a blueprint for future generations,\" she said.one question that still needs to be resolved is the issue of their security bill when they are in canada, said david mcclure, an expert on royal finances.he told bbc breakfast that the overall royal security bill was estimated at more than \u00a3100m a year, and that one canadian security company believed it would cost about \u00a37m a year to protect harry and meghan when they are out of the uk.\"the canadians are not keen on picking up the tab, so i'm sure there will be quite heated discussions between the canadian government and the british government as to who pays for it,\" he said.if they plan to \"maximise the commercial opportunities\", the sussexes may come under pressure to contribute to that cost, mr mcclure added.meghan and harry have already begun a transition phase of living in canada and the uk. the move was agreed by the queen, prince of wales and duke of cambridge.the duchess is in the commonwealth country with son archie, where the sussexes spent six weeks over the festive period.on tuesday she visited a charity in vancouver which campaigns for teenage girls living in poverty.on thursday,  -

and musically-speaking, it was a time of innovation, upheaval and disruption. streaming changed the way we listened to music, and music changed in response to the way we listened. songs got shorter, genres bled into one another, and language barriers dissolved.observing all these changes were charlie harding, a songwriter, and nate sloan, a professor of musicology. before the 2010s, they'd been snobby about pop music. then, on a road trip, they heard carly rae jepsen's exquisitely catchy call me maybe.they were struck by the way jepsen subverted their expectations of melody and arrangement to create a feeling of awkward nervousness as she asked a guy out on a date.\"jepsen hesitates before singing the first word of the chorus, ','\" they explain. \"it's unexpected, but effective, like she's working up the courage to say her piece.the chorus's underlying chord progression reinforces this feeling, deliberately avoiding the song's harmonic \"home\" in a way that makes the listener \"feel giddily unmoored,\" they add.inspired by jepsen's masterpiece, the duo launched a podcast called  in 2014, dissecting the musical concepts behind hits like ,  and, erm, .now they have a book by the same name - subtitled \"how popular music works and why it matters\" - with each chapter studying a basic principle of music through the prism of a single, ubiquitous banger.we called them up in the dying days of 2019 to discuss the decade's biggest musical trends, and how they shaped our experience of music.the decade had its fair share of memorable hooks, from pharrell's  to sia's  - but choruses suffered an identity crisis during the decade.take, for example, katy perry's . the bridge builds and builds in anticipation of a climax (perry even sings \"\") but when you get to the bit where the chorus should be, the song disappears down a black hole and you're left with a spooky synth riff over a pounding bass drum. \"this was one of the most surprising insights we found when researching the podcast and writing the book,\" says sloan. \"since the 1960s, it's been a tenet of popular music that all songs follow the verse-chorus format, but the last decade has seen a real shift away from the dominance of the chorus.\"in their book, sloan and harding trace this phenomenon back to rihanna and calvin harris's we found love. released in 2011, the song initially behaves like any other pop song, with a verse-chorus structure that culminates in rihanna singing the hook, \"\" four times.but then harris does something unexpected: instead of circling back to the second verse, the tension ratchets up like a rollercoaster climbing to its apex. as a synth rises in pitch and snare drums clatter, the excitement builds until, at 1'08\", there's an almighty crash and the song's elements unite around a single, fist-pumping groove. and it's this section, more than rihanna's hook, that represents the energetic peak of the song.this technique - the build and drop - was borrowed from dance music but compressed to fit the pop format, prompting sloan and harding to christen it \"pop drop\".\"what's fascinating about the pop drop is it helped introduce people's ears to a new song form,\" says harding. \"it made listeners more comfortable with hearing things that don't fit into the dominant structure of the past 75 years.\"and so we end up with songs like dark horse, or ariana grande's , or the chainsmokers' , where the chorus is no longer the focal-point of the song.\"to me, that's the most exciting development of the last 10 years - the disintegration of the chorus and the slate of possibilities that will open up for artists in the future,\" says sloan.\"it's very hard to do something like that,\" chips in harding. \"think about drama, for example - it's difficult to have a play that doesn't have three acts, because form is often the thing that gives us comfort.\"so even though the pop drop itself might be more of a mid-2010s phenomenon, it's very important in terms of how it disrupted the standards.\"according to research from , the average length of a song on the billboard hot 100 fell from 3'50\" in 2013, to about 3'30\" in 2018 - and the trend appears to be accelerating. last year, lil nas x became one of music's biggest break-out stars thanks to his viral hit , a song that's just 1'52\" long.the downward pressure on song durations is all down to streaming. \"streaming services incentivise listening to an entire song, because that's how they calculate payments,\" explains sloan. \"and if you listen to the whole song, it increases the likelihood of it being placed on a playlist.\"furthermore, streaming services pay artists per play - irrespective of how long a song lasts. so every time someone streams kanye west's 2010 nine-minute epic , it generates the same revenue as a play of the three-minute-long . it's no surprise that his latest single, follow god, clocks in at 1'45\".\"the trend is definitely towards shorter songs,\" . \"people are doing two or three things at the same time and if you get three minutes into a song and it's not almost over, you're probably skipping to the next song, and that's just the truth.\"that's not the only effect streaming has had on song structure. intros are shorter - some songs even open with a blast of the chorus - and fade-outs are a thing of the past.\"a fade-out, just like a long intro, is another way to lose people's attention,\" says harding. \"it's a matter of sustaining attention all the way through.\"\"what's the famous adage in playwriting? enter late, leave early,\" adds sloan. \"maybe it's similar in pop songwriting.\"as hip-hop has become the dominant form of music, it's stylistic tropes have begun to bleed into pop. as a result, you hear artists like taylor swift and ed sheeran employing the rhythmic cadence of rap, often in melodies that . the technique gives their songs intimacy and immediacy - it feels like you're being spoken to - and when they finally soar up the musical scale in the chorus, it's like a sunlight piercing a darkened room.sloan traced this phenomenon back to outkast's 2003 hit single \"we found this amazing quotation from andre benjamin, who said he was really nervous to release that song because, at the time, the idea of a rapper singing was unthinkable,\" he says. \"now, if you fast-forward 16 years, it's commonplace. so we really see him as setting that template.\"the other important link in that chain is kanye west's , which really introduced the use of auto-tune as a way for rappers, who may not be comfortable singing, to share their 'beautiful voices' with the world. \"and through those two developments, you get an artist like drake who is constantly oscillating on the edge of rapping and speaking and singing - which in itself is an old technique - in opera it'd be called sprechgesang. \"so it's a relatively recent development in pop, but one which might have longer roots in the history of classical music.\"on 13 december, 2013, beyonc\u00e9 upended the music industry. without warning and without promotion, she dropped an entire album - the self-titled beyonc\u00e9 - accompanied by 17 music videos. three years later, she did it again with lemonade, a visual album that tackled black identity and female empowerment; and hinted that her husband, jay-z, had been unfaithful. accidentally or by design, that record was the first part of a triptych, with jay-z responding on 4:44; before the couple reconciled on a joint album and tour, titled everything is love.\"it's a great example of how an artist today isn't simply a musician, they're entirely inter-textual,\" says harding. \"our relationship to pop acts is no longer just about the song -

and bring up long-forgotten memories. like many who've drunk the brew, rebekah has a wide-eyed distant look as she reminisces about the experience.\"it was like being guided very gently and very kindly through some really awful experiences that i'd had in the past,\" rebekah says. \"and returning back home after that, i felt like my relationships were a lot stronger. i felt it was a lot easier to share and receive love.\"they do say that ayahuasca is like 20 years of psychotherapy. and i completely believe that.\"ayahuasca is usually taken in ceremonies at night, led by a healer - sometimes called a shaman. he or she will drink the sticky brown liquid - a brew of two amazonian plants - then dole out helpings to the participants. it's been used by tribes in the amazon region for centuries but now there's a boom in what's become known as \"ayahuasca tourism\", with ever more specialist retreat centres opening. travellers often come for help dealing with mental health problems - and a growing body of scientific research suggests ayahuasca could be an effective treatment.about half an hour or so into a ceremony, the medicine takes its effect and the healer will start singing sacred chants, known as, which guide the participants through their visions. drinkers usually \"purge\" during ceremonies too, vomiting and sometimes getting diarrhoea as well.when rebekah went on her first ayahuasca retreat, she was the only single woman there and noticed that the male healer was paying her special attention.\"how he treated me was very different, which i didn't find suspicious at the time. but upon reflection, now i do.\"a year later, by now a more experienced ayahuasca drinker, rebekah returned to the same retreat in peru. the same healer was leading the ceremonies.once again, she says, she was treated differently from everyone else. there was a lot of flattery. then the healer began confiding in rebekah. \"he constantly told me that he had a lot of troubles,\" she says, \"and he said he was having problems with his wife, that he wasn't sexually fulfilled, and that i was the one who was able to cure him of that.\"rebekah was 20 at the time; the healer in his 50s.\"he also promised me a lot of spiritual advancement or a lot of spiritual power, if we had a relationship - while his wife was down the road.\"rebekah says the healer sexually abused her, coercing her into sexual acts.\"it's disgusting,\" she says. \"because he was a shaman, i thought he had moral superiority in a sense and i trusted him.\"after she was abused, rebekah left the centre - and the country: \"i booked a flight and got the hell out of there.\"she was left with a tangle of painful emotions: \"disgust, repulsion, betrayal - confusion, as well as to why a guide would do this, why a teacher would do this and why they would exploit their power like that.\"rebekah's alleged abuser is still the head shaman at his centre - which gets five-star ratings on review sites.\"he is still there,\" rebekah says, clearly deeply angered by the situation. her hands are visibly shaking. \"there are other centres that i know of as well that are still operating. there've been multiple women that have been sexually abused in these centres.\"experiences of sexual abuse seem to be widespread in this world. we've heard numerous allegations against numerous healers and read many testimonies of sexual abuse on online forums.one name that comes up repeatedly is guillermo ar\u00e9valo, a well-known healer who's been honoured by the peruvian congress for his work on sustainable development.\"he came to canada many times,\" says a woman in her 40s whom we're calling anna. \"it was quite lucrative - big ceremonies. they'd fill up fast, people paying c$300 (\u00a3175) to come and sit with guillermo. he had kind of a status. it was an honour to sit in ceremony with him.\"anna, who had long been interested in alternative medicine, hoped ayahuasca might help her deal with her addiction to heroin.at first, she was impressed by ar\u00e9valo.\"like a lot of people, you're flabbergasted by the man's presence and power and ability to lead the ceremony - it's quite profound,\" she says. \"the chanting. he is a good healer.\"but a ceremony about seven years ago dramatically changed anna's opinion.\"it was completely pitch black, the room had no windows. there were a lot of people.\"i was under the effects of the medicine. when you're under the effects there's lots of different sounds. people are crying, verbalising things that make no sense at all, purging or moaning.\"even if i had been able to say something, nobody would respond.\"anna was having a difficult time. she recalls lying down, moaning and groaning. \"guillermo came and he sat with me and at first it was a sense of relief because i think i'm going to get some help,\" she says.\"he started to chant to me and put his hands on my stomach over my clothing which is normal. and then he put his hands down my pants. and there's this sense of feeling frozen. i lay there in fear and then he put his hands up my shirt and felt around my breasts.\"she remembers thinking: \"'what the heck was that all about?' just a sense of disbelief and confusion.\"it's taken six years for anna to feel able to speak out about what happened to her.\"women are conditioned to accept this behaviour. for myself, coming from a history of addiction - and i've had abusive relationships with men that i've tolerated in my life - and a history of childhood sexual abuse, there's a sense of familiarity there, of normalcy.\"and also this weird co-dependent relationship for me where the medicine was helping me so i didn't want to speak up because i was afraid i would be ostracised from the community and then i would be kind of cut off from the medicine.\"while preliminary scientific studies have suggested that ayahuasca could have therapeutic benefits, it contains dmt, which is illegal in the uk, and there are potential risks.a 2015 report found six volunteers with depression showed a decrease in symptoms after taking it. a separate study two years later indicated that it held promise as a treatment for eating disorders. psychologists have also speculated that it could help those with ptsd.the foreign and commonwealth office  some people have \"suffered serious illnesses and in some cases death\" after taking part in ayahuasca ceremonies. it points out that retreats are typically some distance from populated areas and that while some have basic medical facilities, others do not.around the same time, a group calling themselves ayahuasca community awareness canada - which included senior academics - put their names to a letter about ar\u00e9valo's behaviour and circulated it within the ayahuasca scene. the letter-writers say they took action because of the number of complaints made against the healer, citing reports of non-consensual or inappropriate sexual behaviour.when further named signatories were added to the letter in 2015 and it was made public, ar\u00e9valo stopped visiting canada to lead ayahuasca ceremonies.but when we track him down it seems he's been active all around the world in the intervening years and is now based at a retreat centre in peru. the place used to be called anaconda but when we're there has its first group of foreign guests under a new name, bena shinan.they're milling around in a dining room behind us when we put the allegations of sexual abuse to ar\u00e9valo, a slight 71-year-old with silver hair and gold teeth.\"i don't accept the allegations because they're not true,\" he says firmly. \"because sometimes people just imagine these things.\"he says he's heard about the letter by members of the canadian ayahuasca community, but has never read it.\"it doesn't interest me because the allegations aren't true,\" he says. \"it doesn't bother me because i don't think an allegation's going to kill me.\"the claims against him, he says, are \"the imaginings of the unwell person\". \"when you touch someone who's been abused or raped, they think you're the same. that's what happens. that's how i make sense of it.\"when we put anna's specific allegation to him, he says he doesn't remember ever touching a patient during a ceremony in canada, saying she too must have imagined it.\"what else is he going to do other than just lie and deny it,\" anna responds. \"otherwise he would have to step up and take responsibility and be accountable for the way he has acted.\"what about his claim that she just imagined the sexual assault?\"it sounds like gaslighting to me, really,\" she says. \"that's what it feels like.\"although ar\u00e9valo denies having sexually abused anyone, he does admit that healers working under him have had sex with \"unwell people\".he says he no longer works with those healers, but that in some cases it was the patients who initiated the relationships.\"western women, when they come, they're also seeking out healers,\" he says.anna's experience with ayahuasca and abuse doesn't end with guillermo ar\u00e9valo. despite her experiences with him, she didn't want to give up the benefits she received from the brew and continued taking it under the guidance of other healers.she says that in 2014 she was raped in ayahuasca ceremonies in peru by a healer who is a member of ar\u00e9valo's extended family.she says again she \"just froze\" and \"let him do whatever he wanted to me\".\"i think he probably raped me four or five times and i noticed he was doing it to other people.\"afterwards, anna says she was in shock. she doesn't remember much about that period of her life.\"i started to develop symptoms of psychosis and ended up relapsing and becoming addicted to fentanyl and overdosed and almost died. i think i really blamed myself for a long time - why i couldn't say no, why i couldn't move, why i let him do those things. those were the things that were going through my mind.\"we've spoken to another guest who was at the same retreat as anna, who says the healer was later sacked from the centre, because of allegations made by other clients. we're not naming him because, despite our best efforts, we haven't been able to reach him to give him the chance to respond to the allegations.emily sinclair, a british doctoral student researching ayahuasca, is part of a group trying to raise awareness about the problem of sexual abuse in the ayahuasca world.working with the chacruna institute, an organisation set up to share research on plant medicines and psychedelics, sinclair helped put together the ayahuasca community guide for the awareness of sexual abuse. the  highlight typical scenarios in which abuse happens. they also encourage people to drink with trusted companions and to research retreats by checking out review websites before they visit.sinclair has been distributing the little green booklet to cafes, tourism offices and ayahuasca centres in the iquitos area of peru, known as the hub of ayahuasca tourism.\"a lot of abuse we've found occurs in the context of individual healings where a woman might be asked to remove her clothes unnecessarily,\" she says. \"and when she's in this unfamiliar context, she doesn't know if that's normal or not.\"sinclair points out that it's not just indigenous healers abusing westerners. \"abuse happens across cultures and within them,\" she says.\"but one of the big problems is that a lot of people who come here romanticise shamans. so we put them on a pedestal. and it's very easy for that image to be taken advantage of.\"there's also assumptions that some of the people here may have about western women and culture.\"some of the red flags sinclair warns people to watch out for echo rebekah's experience.\"if he's overly touchy with you, he tells you his wife doesn't mind him having sex with other women, he encourages pacts of silence and secrecy between you, he says he wants to teach you 'love magic'. this kind of thing. and also that having sex with them will increase their power and energy. these are all things that have been reported to us as being said to women in this context.\"those affected by sexual abuse understandably find it difficult to talk about openly. on top of that, there's a strong sense within the ayahuasca world that any kind of negative publicity could result in government intervention, which creates an additional pressure to stay silent. but rebekah and anna are speaking out because they hope it will prevent other women being abused.\"i think the only thing we can do is just speak out about it and talk about it,\" rebekah says, \"make sure people know that it's happening.\"rebekah says that after she was abused there's been \"a lot of sadness and a lot of therapy\".it's been hard work for her to trust a healer again, but now she's back in peru, taking ayahuasca and researching her master's thesis on indigenous medicine.\"regardless of everything that happened, obviously ayahuasca's great,\" rebekah laughs, \"because i keep going back to it.\" have you experienced abuse in the ayahuasca community anywhere in the world? send us an email using the form below.if you are happy to be contacted by a bbc journalist please leave a telephone number that we can\n                        contact you on. in some cases a selection of your comments will be published, displaying your name as\n                        you provide it and location, unless you state otherwise. your contact details will never be published.\n                        when sending us pictures, video or eyewitness accounts at no time should you endanger yourself or others,\n                        take any unnecessary risks or infringe any laws. please ensure you have read the terms and conditions."}, "14": {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51130644", "author": "By Owen Amos", "title": "why are chinese fishermen finding so many 'submarine spies'?", "date": "16 January 2020", "story_body": "At first it seems like a quirky, what-are-the-chances-of-that headline: ", "article_text": "at first it seems like a quirky, what-are-the-chances-of-that headline: but behind that headline in chinese state media, there is a different - and more intriguing - story.firstly, this wasn't two or three fishermen receiving awards. it was 11 - one woman, the rest men - who found seven devices in total.secondly, this wasn't the first time fishermen from jiangsu had found \"spy drones\". in 2018, some 18 were rewarded for finding nine devices. there was also a ceremony a year earlier.and thirdly, the rewards were huge - up to 500,000 yuan ($72,000; \u00a355,000) - around 17 times the average disposable income in china.so where do the \"submarine spies\" come from? what do they do? why are they valuable? and why are chinese fishermen finding so many?jiangsu is a province in eastern china, with a coastline more than 1,000km (620 miles) long.it faces japan and south korea, while taiwan is around 500 miles south. this geography - and the - begins to explain why fishermen keep finding these devices.china has not revealed where the devices came from, merely saying they were \"made in other countries\". but regional expert and consultant alexander neill says they probably came from \"the us navy, the japan self-defense forces, or potentially taiwan - this is a big area of rivalry\".so what are the americans, the japanese, or the taiwanese hoping to learn?in 2009, the us navy  into underwater drones, broadly known as \"unmanned undersea vehicles (uuvs)\". the research recommended seven ways uuvs could be used, including:the research also highlighted the strengths of uuvs. gliders - a smaller uuv, likely to be what the jiangsu fishermen found - can be deployed for \"months\" and are \"cheap enough to be considered expendable\".in this instance, cheap means \"only tens of thousands of dollars\".their cost, range, and capability mean \"submarine spies\" are increasingly important - mr neill estimates the number worldwide is \"certainly in the upper hundreds\".so this explains - in part - why they keep turning up in chinese nets. the country has a huge fishing fleet, and the law of averages suggests it will scoop up the occasional drone.but it's also true that china's fleet is different to other countries'. some fishermen, themselves, are part of the military - and understanding how this unique unit works could explain why they keep finding military hardware.the chinese maritime militia is part of the national militia - that is, the reserve civilian forces. it is \"virtually unique and publicly obscure\",  from the us naval war college - but it is well-known to the united states military.according to a 2017 report by the us department of defense, the cmm has played \"significant roles in a number of military campaigns and coercive incidents over the years\".in the past, the cmm rented vessels from companies or fishermen. but now, the dod says, \"it appears china is building a state-owned fishing fleet for its militia force\".indeed, mr neill says many boats are merely \"masquerading as fishing vessels - they're actually doing naval and maritime surveillance against china's rivals\".\"on paper they look like sophisticated, modern trawlers,\" he says. \"but they are actually, essentially, military-type vessels - steel-hulled, not wooden-hulled, with increasing tonnage.\"if you look at photographs, it's clear they're networked in - because of their signalling capabilities - with the [regular navy] command and control network.\"in effect, the fishing fleet can provide a low-level, first line of defence or surveillance - a military force working under a civilian cloak.\"a very significant swathe of china's fishing fleet is co-opted into the militia,\" says mr neill. \"i would have thought, with a little digging, you would find these guys [the jiangsu fishermen] may well be part of it.\"china doesn't just find underwater drones - it operates them, too.at the military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the people's republic of china (prc), the hsu001 was unveiled - a large uuv, possibly capable of launching smaller drones.and five months earlier, another chinese uuv was revealed in a less formal way, when indonesian fishermen caught a \"missile\" with chinese markings in the riau islands.\"it's not a missile, but a sea drone, which is usually used for underwater research,\" although its origin was not confirmed, experts suspect it was part of china's vast sub-surface surveillance - the so-called \"great underwater wall of china\".so, as uuv technology develops, more fishermen - whether in china, indonesia, or beyond - can expect to find more drones.\"they [drones] are extending the range of surveillance capacity for all of the modern navies in the region,\" says mr neill. and - as the jiangsu prize-winners discovered - they can be a valuable catch."}, "15": {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51046656", "author": "By Guy Delauney", "title": "naked artists in serbia breathing life into damaged art scene", "date": "13 January 2020", "story_body": "\"The fact that I do performances nude, in Belgrade and Serbia, means a lot for somebody who is queer and whose body is queer,\" Aleks Zain says.

the only instance when a constitutional amendment has been overturned in this way.prohibition is now viewed as a failure. no major political parties or organisations support its return, and there is little public support for such an extreme response in the future.but alcohol remains controversial in the us. the drinking age of 21 is higher than in other nations where drinking is legal. dry counties and dry towns - where alcohol sales are restricted or barred outright - are dotted throughout the country. and gallup polling from last year shows that . a century on, a small group of americans are fighting to keep the dream of the so-called \"noble experiment\" alive.\"you should think of the prohibition party as an exercise in living history,\" says jim hedges, treasurer to the party, which is the third-oldest in the us. \"we're trying to keep the concept alive and the history alive,\" he tells the bbc. \"but as far as getting big enough to have influence, it's not going to happen any time soon.\"the us temperance movement, which sought to control or even ban alcohol sales, developed through the 19th century. campaigners focused on the perceived immorality of drinking as well as the health effects. religious groups like methodists and later organisations like the anti-saloon league helped bring about the law change.dr julia guarneri, senior lecturer in us history at the university of cambridge, tells the bbc that women's groups - in particular the woman's christian temperance union (wctu) - were vital in bringing about prohibition. \"they thought alcohol was one way that money went from the employer to the employee to the saloon, and never reached the family,\" dr guarneri says. women and children were also victims of abuse from alcoholic husbands and fathers. as reformers pushed for women's right to vote - ratified in the 19th amendment, which was officially adopted just eight months after prohibition took effect - women activists also sought to ban alcohol, seeing it as another way that women were oppressed in society. \"there's more of a connect between those two pieces of legislation than you might think,\" dr guarneri says. \"the wctu saw the banning of alcohol as a way both to keep families happier and healthier, and women happier and healthier.\"worries about the large numbers of immigrants coming to us shores at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries - in particular catholics and jews travelling from southern and eastern europe - were another factor.some european catholics in particular brought a beer-drinking culture to the us which was alien to its protestant populations. but on top of this, both catholics and jews incorporate alcohol in their religious rituals. while these ceremonies were still allowed during prohibition, dr guarneri says that alcohol \"became a way to police and oppress those immigrant populations\".the start of world war i further helped the temperance movement. campaigners won support arguing that grains should be used for food rather than for beer during the conflict, while german immigrants or their descendants owned many of the breweries. \"so it was very easy to paint a portrait of alcohol being un-american,\" dr guarneri says. \"you name it - pabst, schlitz, budweiser... there wasn't going to be a lot of public sympathy for the owners of the breweries from the us.\"but prohibition was widely flouted. many americans, particularly the wealthy and the privileged, dodged the law with ease. president warren harding is said to have openly served alcohol confiscated by his government at the white house. the law grew more and more unpopular. politicians also missed the tax revenue from alcohol sales after the wall street crash of 1929. franklin roosevelt promised to repeal the measure in his bid for the presidency in 1932, and within a year of him coming to office, national prohibition was dead. sarah ward, former president of the wctu, tells the bbc that prohibition \"probably did our organisation more harm than good after the repeal\".to join the wctu, applicants must pledge to avoid alcohol and pay membership dues. ms ward signed up as a teenager in the 1950s, and has kept that pledge to this day.she spent decades teaching people about the health impact of alcohol, and says she is proud of that work. but she said the current state of the temperance movement in the us was \"very discouraging\". \"we can always hope that somebody will realise and a corner will be turned and that'll be great if it happens,\" ms ward says - although she thinks members of the wctu are \"more realistic\" now.\"today, as far as prohibition is concerned, we will have that when each individual makes the choice that that is the best way for them to live,\" she said. \"we can't get restrictions on anything. everybody wants to be free and do their own thing.\"prohibition party treasurer jim hedges agrees. mr hedges was the party's presidential candidate in 2016 when they took just 5,600 votes nationwide - albeit far more than the 518 they won in 2012, and their best result since 1988. he says the party would like to see a \"sea change\" of public opinion to allow the return of national prohibition. \"if we were to try to impose that from the top down without having public support, it would be unenforceable,\" he says. their plan this year is to focus on states which have easier rules for smaller parties to get on the ballot.phil collins, the party's 2020 nominee, hopes they can get on the ballot in arkansas, colorado, louisiana, mississippi and tennessee.\"four years ago the party was on the ballot in only three states. and this time it'll be five states,\" he tells the bbc. \"so i'm sure we'll get more votes than we did then.\"dry counties and towns, and so-called \"blue laws\" - restrictions on when and where you can buy alcohol, for example on a sunday or after a certain time at night - exist across the us. but the general trend is for more liberalisation. massachusetts had about 20 wholly dry towns in the year 2000, but several have started to allow the sale of alcohol - albeit in restricted ways. the town of rockport was dry from 1856, when organiser hannah jumper rallied women to attack liquor-serving establishments with hatchets. a referendum in 2005 finally granted restaurants the right to serve alcohol with meals, but it was only in 2019 - close to 162 years after the infamous \"hatchet gang\" raid - that the town granted its first retail licence to sell alcohol. jay smith tells the bbc that after the town's only grocery store closed, the community decided to grant a licence to the first person to open a store in rockport. his family opened the whistlestop market, which sells beer and wine at a mall by the train station.mr smith says the town has been overwhelmingly supportive, barring \"maybe one or two people [who] have let us know that they're against it.\" but ultimately, he says it is a matter of personal choice. \"i think prohibition was a response to the difficulties of alcohol. though we sell alcohol, we're for responsible use,\" he says. \"people can have a personal or philosophical attitude against alcohol - i can't argue against that. that's their personal choice and that's what's right for them.\""}, "17": {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51166732", "author": "Unknown", "title": "czech fire: eight killed at disabled people's home", "date": "19 January 2020", "story_body": "At least eight people have been killed after a fire broke out at a disabled people's home in the Czech Republic.", "article_text": "at least eight people have been killed after a fire broke out at a disabled people's home in the czech republic.thirty others were injured in the incident in the western town of vejprty, on the border with germany.the cause of the fire is unclear. german rescuers had joined czech crews, local officials said, but bad weather hampered their efforts. it was the second most deadly fire in the czech republic since 1990, according to lidov\u00e9 noviny newspaper.nine homeless people died in a fire in the capital, prague, in 2010.vejprty is located some 100km (60 miles) north-west of prague.the fire was reported at 04:49 (03:49 gmt), said emergency services spokesman prokop volenik.mr volenik said seven ambulance units including two german ones were involved. he said the fire had been brought under control.\"the fire broke out in the boys' section,\" said vejprty mayor jitka gavdunova, adding it had then spread.the eight victims died from smoke inhalation. prime minister andrej babis travelled to vejprty and promised help with the investigation.\"it is a huge tragedy,\" he told reporters."}, "18": {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51166339", "author": "Unknown", "title": "facebook blames 'technical issue' for offensive xi jinping translation", "date": "19 January 2020", "story_body": "Facebook has apologised for translating Chinese President Xi Jinping's name from Burmese to English into an obscenity on its platform.

for the proceedings.opening statements in the trial will begin next week.mr trump is only the third us president in history to face an impeachment trial. he is accused of abuse of power and obstruction of congress. he has denied wrongdoing and branded the case against him as a \"hoax\".the house of representatives, controlled by the democrats, impeached the president last month. the senate, controlled by mr trump's republican party, will decide whether to convict and remove him from office.a two-thirds majority of 67 votes in the 100-seat senate is required to convict and oust mr trump. but because there are only 45 democrats (along with 53 republicans and two independents), the president is widely expected to be cleared.in their brief filed earlier on saturday, house democrats laid out their arguments for why mr trump should be removed from office. they said the president had \"abandoned his oath to faithfully execute the laws and betrayed his public trust\", and called his conduct the \"worst nightmare\" of the country's founding fathers.the six-page response outlines the defence the president's legal team expects to use in the upcoming impeachment trial.the team, led by white house counsel pat cipollone and mr trump's personal lawyer jay sekulow, said they were challenging the impeachment on both procedural and constitutional grounds, claiming that the president did nothing wrong and had not been treated fairly. their filing said the articles of impeachment submitted by house democrats were a \"dangerous attack on the right of the american people to freely choose their president.\"\"this is a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election, now just months away,\" it added. mr trump and his legal team said the impeachment charges failed to allege \"any crime or violation of law\" and were \"the result of a lawless process that violated basic due process and fundamental fairness\".the lawyers said mr trump \"categorically and unequivocally\" denies all allegations.the filing on saturday came a day after mr trump finalised his defence team, which includes special prosecutors from former president bill clinton's impeachment.in their own 111-page filing on saturday, democratic lawmakers leading the case against mr trump summarised arguments made during weeks of testimony in the impeachment investigation last year. they said the president should be convicted and removed from office \"to avoid serious and long term damage to our democratic values and the nation's security.\"\"the case against the president of the united states is simple, the facts are indisputable, and the evidence is overwhelming,\" they said.\"the only remaining question is whether the members of the senate will accept and carry out the responsibility placed on them by the framers of our constitution and their constitutional oaths,\" they added. president trump is accused of pressuring ukraine to dig up damaging information on one of his main democratic challengers for the presidency in 2020, joe biden, and his son hunter.hunter worked for a ukrainian company when joe biden was us vice-president.the president is accused of dangling two things as bargaining chips to ukraine - withholding $400m of military aid to ukraine that had already been allocated by congress, and a white house meeting for ukraine's president.democrats say this amounts to an abuse of presidential power.mr trump is also accused of obstructing congress by refusing to co-operate with the congressional inquiry.the us president was impeached last month, opening the way for a senate trial.in the unlikely event of mr trump being found guilty, he would be removed from office and

2017, puerto rico has been hit by a series of hurricanes and earthquakes. the island is still recovering from hurricane maria, a category-five storm that devastated parts of the caribbean in september 2017. in puerto rico alone, the hurricane is estimated to have killed 2,975 people and caused $100bn (\u00a375bn) of damage.the island was hit by the strongest quake in 102 years early this month. at one point in the aftermath, two-thirds of the population had no power. one of the worst affected areas was the city of ponce, in the south of the island.video of ponce residents breaking into the

it would use if one of its crew-carrying rockets ever developed a problem during flight.the rehearsal at kennedy space center saw a falcon-9 vehicle's ascent into the sky deliberately terminated just 80 seconds after lift-off. the dragon astronaut capsule on top fired its escape engines to carry itself clear of the \"faulty\" booster.parachutes brought the vessel to a safe splashdown some 30km off florida.no humans were involved in the practice abort; the only occupants of the dragon ship were a couple of anthropomorphic test devices, or \"dummies\".this was considered to be the last major milestone for california's spacex company before the us space agency (nasa) certifies the firm to carry astronauts to the international space station (iss) later this year.nasa has contracted both spacex and the aerospace giant boeing to take over routine transportation of astronauts to low-earth orbit.not since the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011 have american crews been able to launch from american soil.the apparently flawless in-flight abort demonstrated on sunday should bring this long hiatus to close, perhaps by early summer.spacex had promised the escape manoeuvre would be spectacular, and so it proved.as the dragon capsule fired its escape engines, the falcon booster underneath lost aerodynamic stability, broke apart and exploded in a huge ball of flame.but by then, the crew capsule was well away, continuing to climb skyward thanks to its powerful superdraco thrusters. onboard video showed the dragon drop its service-module segment, or \"trunk\", before releasing two drogue parachutes.four main chutes then emerged.these large envelopes lowered dragon into the waters of the atlantic ocean a little over nine minutes after the falcon's lift-off.  teams from spacex and the us air force were stationed offshore to begin the recovery of the capsule and bring it back to land.company ceo elon musk lauded everyone involved in the test and marvelled at some of the day's statistics: \"the peak velocity of dragon during abort was more than double the speed of sound, mach 2.2, and achieved an altitude of 40km, 131,000ft. these are exciting specs, for [dragon] to have gone to three times the altitude of a typical airliner,\" he told reporters. trust me... surviving a rocket failure by way of a successful abort system made today\u2019s test personal. thank you  &  guardian angels! end of twitter post  by @astrohaguethe importance of having an effective abort capability was underlined by the 2018 experience of russian cosmonaut alexey ovchinin and nasa flight engineer nick hague.they were in the midst of a routine journey to the iss when their soyuz rocket damaged itself two minutes into the ascent. the men only escaped death because their capsule also had an emergency system to pull the vessel to safety.it will be recalled also that the challenger space shuttle in 1986 had no such escape capability and all seven crew members died when the orbiter began to break up 72 seconds into its mission.nick hague tweeted after watching sunday's demonstration: \"trust me... surviving a rocket failure by way of a successful abort system made today's test personal. thank you @spacex & @usairforce guardian angels!\"both spacex and boeing were supposed to make their \"astronaut taxi services\" available in 2017, but the companies have had to grapple with - and overcome - some tricky technical challenges.spacex, for example, saw one of its capsules explode on a testbed in april last year. and boeing, which calls its crew capsule starliner, hit trouble on an uncrewed dummy run to the space station last month. the starliner experienced an anomaly immediately after launch that led it to waste fuel reserves, leaving it short of the propellant necessary to reach the orbiting outpost.all that said, it seems likely both spacex and boeing will get to debut crewed flights in the coming months.nasa has selected shuttle veterans doug hurley and bob behnken to make the first dragon crewed flight. mr musk said their capsule would be at kennedy shortly and could be ready to fly before july.but nasa administrator jim bridenstine said the \"go for launch\" for hurley and behnken might depend on how long the agency wanted the men to stay on the space station. \"do we want that first crew to be a short duration (mission)? or do we want it to be a longer duration? if it's going to be a longer duration, then we have to have some additional training for our astronauts to actually be prepared to do things on the international space station that we weren't planning to have that initial test crew necessarily do.\" and follow me on twitter: "}, "23": {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51168400", "author": "Unknown", "title":

got what they want. and for some that is enough. round one to the sussexes.but the price is high, much higher than it was originally thought. the sussexes and the palace first hoped there might be a way to keep the couple half-in half-out, perhaps with select but high visibility royal duties in and out of the uk.that's not happening. royal through blood and marriage they will always be.  but professionally royal, publicly royal, they no longer are. they will carry out no duties, no tours, use no royal title. that royal part their life - all of harry's life - is over. it is a huge step. only edward viii went further, and his is a bitter example. no one has won. everyone - family, crown and country - has lost.last year, prince harry and meghan spoke of the difficulties of royal life and media scrutiny, with the duke saying he feared his wife would fall victim to \"the same powerful forces\" that led to his mother's death.in her statement on saturday, the queen said she was pleased that a \"constructive and supportive way forward for [her] grandson and his family\" had been found. buckingham palace said the duke and duchess understood that under the new arrangement, they were required to withdraw from royal duties, including official military appointments, but would continue to \"uphold the values of her majesty\".the duke and duchess intend to repay \u00a32.4m of taxpayer money used for the refurbishment of frogmore cottage, the statement said.the house in windsor, for which they will pay rent, will remain their family home as they divide their time between the uk and canada.the pair will continue to maintain their private patronages and associations - the duke currently holds 16 patronages, including the invictus games foundation, the royal marines and the rugby football league; and the duchess four - the national theatre, the association of commonwealth universities, london-based animal charity mayhew, and women's charity smart works.they will no longer use hrh, an abbreviation of his/her royal highness, which is part of the title of some members of the royal family.some questions about the couple's future status remain unanswered, including what their tax and immigration status will be in the uk and canada. it is not yet known whether meghan still intends to gain british citizenship, which would entail her spending a certain amount of time in the uk. another question is the issue of their security bill when they are in canada, said david mcclure, an expert on royal finances.\"the canadians are not keen on picking up the tab, so i'm sure there will be quite heated discussions between the canadian government and the british government as to who pays for it,\" he said, adding that the sussexes might come under pressure to
